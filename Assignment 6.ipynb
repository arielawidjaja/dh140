    "5 Stars. Pro tip: Lots of parking available on the main street and side streets from this restaurant. There's indoor and outdoor seating so very covid friendly. It is a smaller space but it fits surprisingly a good number of people inside. They also have deals on great bottles of wine sometimes - call ahead! A friend told me this was the best pasta he's had.. and he's from New Jersey so you know that's a high compliment! We came on a random Wednesday night and were seated immediately. They serve fresh bread that I couldn't stop devouring. Pomodoro Trattoria itself is a cozy, intimate environment so perfect for a casual date or catching up with friends. We ordered: Gnocchi (must have - they have so many different options of gnocchi and all made fresh) Tortellini (wow! this is my favorite so far) Pollo Alla Parmigiana (so delicious) Prices are very reasonable. Pasta tastes amazingly fresh and cooked al dente. It's definitely become one of my favorite spots!\n",

Glad I was finally able to try, as the food here was very delicious. The meal started out with warm bread, which was really nice and I ended up taking the leftovers home. I got the daily special which was a seafood linguini, and it came with a generous amount of squid, baby scallops, We shared a chicken parmesan and my partner ordered the gnocchi al funghi. The gnocchi was my favorite of the three -- the mushroom, tomato sauce, and fresh gnocchi just made for a perfect dish. It was way too much food for the two of us, so we ended up having leftovers that held up well even into the next day.\n",

I ordered a rigatoni alla toscana with no cheese. As I was waiting for my food, they gave me some complimentary bread. The bread was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. On a cold day, these breads were a perfect way to start off my dinner. The pasta was better than what I was expecting as well. I mixed the chicken in the pasta to get an even distribution of the tomato sauce. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. Not a single piece of chicken was dry. The tomato sauce was not overbearing or strong, which I liked. The pasta itself was a bit more chewy than I was expecting but still tasty nonetheless. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with the pasta. Portion size was way more than what I had expected too. My bill came out to only be around $15 dollars which I thought was well worth my money. I definitely recommend checking this place out.\n",

There were many waiters walking around to help you. The place is not that big but it's very cozy. Portions are huge! I shared between myself and a friend. When going to an Italian restaurant, I received the good advice to only get fresh-made pasta dishes (because otherwise you could just buy uncooked pasta and make it at home). So, I chose the Gnocchi, which is made fresh daily. It had a fantastic texture- very soft. Sometimes I get tired of eating gnocchi when it's just like a ball of dough, but this was great!\n",

The garlic bread was great, very garlicky for those garlic lovers. The tiramisu was also delicious a nice way to end the meal. I would say this is more of a place to get pasta for sure!!

The pasta comes with bow tie pasta, sautéed chicken, shallots, spinach, tomato sauce, and cream. It was very creamy and not that salty. I felt like the pasta could've been cooked just a bit more, but overall, it was pretty good! We also ordered their Risotto con pollo melanzane ($14.50) which comes with Arborio rice, grilled eggplant, tomato sauce, garlic, basil, and grilled chicken. The chicken was a bit dry, but very crispy outside. Lastly, we ordered one of the grilled appetizers ($11), which was seasoned really well with olive oil, garlic, and fresh herbs.

(Hard to believe for pesto.) The bolognese was mediocre. And the chicken dish with mushroom cream sauce my daughter ordered was a good attempt, but also fell short. I love Chianti, but the house version matched the entrees in blandness. If I hadn't seen the waiter open the bottle, I would have sworn it was watered down. Decent bread, subpar olive oil. When I'm at an Italian restaurant and the best thing is the salad, it's not a great meal. It doesn't rate a 2, but a 3 is a little generous. It seemed popular with the pre-game UCLA crowd.

It was basically gnocchi in glorified pizza sauce. While the sauce wasn't particularly special, it was still tasty. The real star was the gnocchi. Despite the weight of it, the gnocchi was still so fluffy and soft. I'd order it again, but probably with a different sauce. To make up for the long wait, the owner gave us a slice of tiramisu.
