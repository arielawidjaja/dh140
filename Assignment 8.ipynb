Therefore            20\\n  I will push Montague\\'s men from the wall, and\\n  thrust his maids to the wall.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ The quarrel is between our masters and\\n  us their men.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ \\'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant;\\n  when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel\\n  with the maids and cut off their heads.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ Draw thy tool; here comes two of the\\n  house of the Montagues.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I                     30\\n  will back thee.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ How? turn thy back and run?\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Fear me not.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ No, marry; I fear thee!\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Let us take the law of our sides; let\\n  them begin.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ I will frown as I pass by, and let them\\n  take it as they list.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb\\n  at them, which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.             40\\n\\n_Enter_ ABRAM _and_ BALTHASAR\\n\\n  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  _Sampson._ I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\n  _Abram._ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  _Sampson._ [_Aside to Gregory_] Is the law of our\\n  side, if I say ay?\\n\\n  _Gregory._ No.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you,\\n  sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\n  _Abram._ Quarrel, sir! no, sir.                                   50\\n\\n  _Sampson._ If you do, sir, I am for you; I serve as\\n  good a man as you.\\n\\n  _Abram._ No better.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Well, sir.\\n\\n  _Gregory._ [_Aside to Sampson_] Say \\'better\\'; here\\n  comes one of my master\\'s kinsmen.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Yes, better, sir.\\n\\n  _Abram._ You lie.\\n\\n  _Sampson._ Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember\\n  thy swashing blow.

I hate the word,\\n  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee;\\n  Have at thee, coward!\\n                                                     [_They fight._\\n\\n_Enter several of both houses who join the fray; then enter_ Citizens,\\n_with clubs_\\n\\n  _First Citizen_.

Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\n  _Lady Capulet_. A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?\\n\\n  _Capulet._ My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\\n  And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\n\\n_Enter_ MONTAGUE _and_ LADY MONTAGUE\\n\\n  _Montague._ Thou villain Capulet!--Hold me not, let me go.\\n\\n  _Lady Montague._ Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.\\n\\n_Enter_ PRINCE, _with his train_\\n\\n  _Prince._ Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\n  Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--\\n  Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,                80\\n  That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\n  With purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\n  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\n  Throw your mistemper\\'d weapons to the ground,\\n  And hear the sentence of your moved prince.--\\n  Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\n  By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\n  Have thrice disturb\\'d the quiet of our streets,\\n  And made Verona\\'s ancient citizens\\n  Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,                          90\\n  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\n  Canker\\'d with peace, to part your canker\\'d hate.\\n  If ever you disturb our streets again,\\n  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.--\\n  For this time, all the rest depart away.--\\n  You, Capulet, shall go along with me;--\\n  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,\\n  To know our further pleasure in this case,\\n  To old Freetown, our common judgment-place.--\\n  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.                     100\\n           [_Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio._\\n\\n  _Montague._ Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\n  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Here were the servants of your adversary\\n  And yours close fighting ere I did approach.\\n  I drew to part them; in the instant came\\n  The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepar\\'d,\\n  Which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears,\\n  He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\n  Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn.\\n  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,                   110\\n  Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\n  Till the prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\n  _Lady Montague._ O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?\\n  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun\\n  Peer\\'d forth the golden window of the east,\\n  A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\n  Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\n  That westward rooteth from the city\\'s side,\\n  So early walking did I see your son.                             120\\n  Towards him I made, but he was ware of me\\n  And stole into the covert of the wood;\\n  I, measuring his affections by my own,\\n  Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\n  Being one too many by my weary self,\\n  Pursued my humour, not pursuing his,\\n  And gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me.\\n\\n  _Montague._ Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\n  With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,\\n  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;                130\\n  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\n  Should in the farthest east begin to draw\\n  The shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bed,\\n  Away from light steals home my heavy son,\\n  And private in his chamber pens himself,\\n  Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\\n  And makes himself an artificial night.\\n  Black and portentous must this humour prove,\\n  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.                        139\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\n  _Montague._ I neither know it nor can learn of him.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Have you importun\\'d him by any means?\\n\\n  _Montague._ Both by myself and many other friends;\\n  But he, his own affections\\' counsellor,\\n  Is to himself--I will not say how true--\\n  But to himself so secret and so close,\\n  So far from sounding and discovery,\\n  As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\n  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\n  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.                               150\\n  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\n  We would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n_Enter_ ROMEO\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ See, where he comes!

What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?        160\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Not having that which, having, makes them short.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ In love?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Out--\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Of love?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Out of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,\\n  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,\\n  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\n  Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?\\n  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.                        171\\n  Here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\\n  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\n  O any thing, of nothing first created!\\n  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\n  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\n  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\n  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\\n  This love feel I that feel no love in this.\\n  Dost thou not laugh?\\n\\n  _Benvolio._                   No, coz, I rather weep.            180\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Good heart, at what?\\n\\n  _Benvolio._                   At thy good heart\\'s oppression.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Why, such is love\\'s transgression.\\n  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\n  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\n  With more of thine; this love that thou hast shown\\n  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\n  Love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs;\\n  Being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;\\n  Being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears.\\n  What is it else? a madness most discreet,                        190\\n  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\n  Farewell, my coz.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._       Soft! I will go along;\\n  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here;\\n  This is not Romeo, he\\'s some other where.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Tell me in sadness who is that you love.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\n  _Benvolio._                       Groan! why, no,\\n  But sadly tell me who.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Bid a sick man in sadness make his will;\\n  Ah, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill!                        200\\n  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ I aim\\'d so near when I suppos\\'d you lov\\'d.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ A right good mark-man! And she\\'s fair I love.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Well, in that hit you miss. She\\'ll not be hit\\n  With Cupid\\'s arrow; she hath Dian\\'s wit,\\n  And, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d,\\n  From Love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d.\\n  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\n  Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,                        210\\n  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\n  O, she is rich in beauty! only poor\\n  That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\n  For beauty starv\\'d with her severity\\n  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\n  She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\n  To merit bliss by making me despair;\\n  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow                       220\\n  Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Be rul\\'d by me, forget to think of her.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ O, teach me how I should forget to think.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ By giving liberty unto thine eyes;\\n  Examine other beauties.\\n\\n  _Romeo._                         \\'Tis the way\\n  To call hers, exquisite, in question more.\\n  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows,\\n  Being black, put us in mind they hide the fair.\\n  He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\n  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.                      230\\n  Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\n  What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\n  Where I may read who pass\\'d that passing fair?\\n  Farewell; thou canst not teach me to forget.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ I\\'ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.\\n                                                         [_Exeunt._\\n\\n\\nSCENE II. _A Street_\\n\\n_Enter_ CAPULET, PARIS, _and_ Servant\\n\\n  _Capulet._ But Montague is bound as well as I,\\n  In penalty alike; and \\'tis not hard, I think,\\n  For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\n\\n  _Paris._ Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\n  And pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long.\\n  But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\n\\n  _Capulet._ But saying o\\'er what I have said before.\\n  My child is yet a stranger in the world;\\n  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.\\n  Let two more summers wither in their pride                        10\\n  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\n\\n  _Paris._ Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\n\\n  _Capulet._ And too soon marr\\'d are those so early made.\\n  The earth hath swallow\\'d all my hopes but she,\\n  She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\n  But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\\n  My will to her consent is but a part;\\n  An she agree, within her scope of choice\\n  Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\n  This night I hold an old accustom\\'d feast,                        20\\n  Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\n  Such as I love; and you, among the store,\\n  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\n  At my poor house look to behold this night\\n  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\n  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\n  When well-apparell\\'d April on the heel\\n  Of limping winter treads, even such delight\\n  Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\n  Inherit at my house.

What counterfeit\\n  did I give you?\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ The slip, sir, the slip; can you not                  50\\n  conceive?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was\\n  great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain\\n  courtesy.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ That\\'s as much as to say, such a case\\n  as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Meaning, to curtsy.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Thou hast most kindly hit it.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ A most courteous exposition.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.                  60\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Pink for flower.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Right.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Why, then is my pump well flowered.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Well said; follow me this jest now till\\n  thou hast worn out thy pump, that when the single\\n  sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing\\n  sole singular.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ O single-souled jest, solely singular for\\n  the singleness!\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Come between us, good Benvolio; my                    70\\n  wits fail.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or\\n  I\\'ll cry a match.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase,\\n  I have done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in\\n  one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole\\n  five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Thou wast never with me for any thing\\n  when thou was not there for the goose.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.            80\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Nay, good goose, bite not.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is\\n  a most sharp sauce.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ And is it not well served in to a sweet\\n  goose?\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches\\n  from an inch narrow to an ell broad!\\n\\n  _Romeo._ I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\'\\n  which added to the goose proves thee far and wide\\n  a broad goose.                                                    90\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Why, is not this better now than groaning\\n  for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou\\n  Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well\\n  as by nature; for this drivelling love is like a great\\n  natural,--\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Stop there, stop there.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Here\\'s goodly gear!\\n\\n_Enter_ NURSE _and_ PETER\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ A sail, a sail!\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ Two, two; a shirt and a smock.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Peter!                                                  100\\n\\n  _Peter._ Anon!\\n\\n  _Nurse._ My fan, Peter.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Good Peter, to hide her face; for her\\n  fan\\'s the fairer of the two.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Is it good den?\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ \\'Tis no less, I tell you, for the hand of\\n  the dial is now upon the prick of noon.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Out upon you! what a man are you!                       110\\n\\n  _Romeo._ One, gentlewoman, that God hath made\\n  for himself to mar.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ By my troth, it is well said; \\'for himself\\n  to mar,\\' quoth a\\'?--Gentlemen, can any of you tell\\n  me where I may find the young Romeo?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ I can tell you; but young Romeo will be\\n  older when you have found him than he was when\\n  you sought him. I am the youngest of that name,\\n  for fault of a worse.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ You say well.                                           120\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Yea, is the worst well? very well took,\\n  i\\' faith; wisely, wisely.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence\\n  with you.\\n\\n  _Benvolio._ She will indite him to some supper.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ So ho!\\n\\n  _Romeo._ What hast thou found?\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a\\n  lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be\\n  spent.--Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s?                   130\\n  we\\'ll to dinner thither.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ I will follow you.\\n\\n  _Mercutio._ Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, [_singing_]\\n  \\'lady, lady, lady!\\'              [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Marry, farewell!--I pray you, sir, what\\n  saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his\\n  ropery?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear\\n  himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than\\n  he will stand to in a month.                                     140\\n\\n  _Nurse._ An a\\' speak any thing against me, I\\'ll take\\n  him down an a\\' were lustier than he is, and twenty\\n  such Jacks; and if I cannot, I\\'ll find those that\\n  shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I\\n  am none of his skains-mates.--And thou must stand\\n  by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his\\n  pleasure?\\n\\n  _Peter._ I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I\\n  had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I\\n  warrant you. I dare draw as soon as another man,                 150\\n  if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on\\n  my side.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every\\n  part about me quivers. Scurvy knave!--Pray you,\\n  sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bade\\n  me inquire you out; what she bade me say, I will\\n  keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should\\n  lead her in a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a\\n  very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\n  gentlewoman is young, and, therefore, if you should              160\\n  deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be\\n  offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.\\n  I protest unto thee--\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Good heart, and, i\\' faith, I will tell her as\\n  much. Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman!\\n\\n  _Romeo._ What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost\\n  not mark me.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ I will tell her, sir, that you do protest,\\n  which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.                   170\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Bid her devise some means to come to shrift\\n  This afternoon;\\n  And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell\\n  Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ No, truly, sir, not a penny.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Go to; I say you shall.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ And stay, good nurse; behind the abbey wall\\n  Within this hour my man shall be with thee,\\n  And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,                  180\\n  Which to the high top-gallant of my joy\\n  Must be my convoy in the secret night.\\n  Farewell; be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.\\n  Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,\\n  Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ I warrant thee, my man\\'s as true as steel.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,      190\\n  Lord! when \\'twas a little prating thing--O,\\n  there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would\\n  fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as\\n  lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger\\n  her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer\\n  man; but, I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks\\n  as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not\\n  rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name; R is                 200\\n  for the--No, I know it begins with some other\\n  letter--and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\n  of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to\\n  hear it.\\n\\n  _Romeo._ Commend me to thy lady.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Ay, a thousand times.--[_Exit Romeo_] Peter!\\n\\n  _Peter._ Anon.\\n\\n  _Nurse._ Before, and apace.

Thy head is as full of quarrels as\\n  an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been\\n  beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling.

I do spy a kind of hope,\\n  Which craves as desperate an execution\\n  As that is desperate which we would prevent.                      70\\n  If, rather than to marry County Paris,\\n  Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\\n  Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\\n  A thing like death to chide away this shame\\n  That cop\\'st with death himself to scape from it;\\n  And, if thou dar\\'st, I\\'ll give thee remedy.\\n\\n  _Juliet._ O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\\n  From off the battlements of yonder tower;\\n  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk\\n  Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;                  80\\n  Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,\\n  O\\'er-cover\\'d quite with dead men\\'s rattling bones,\\n  With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\\n  Or bid me go into a new-made grave\\n  And hide me with a dead man in his shroud,--\\n  Things, that to hear them told, have made me tremble,--\\n  And I will do it without fear or doubt,\\n  To live an unstain\\'d wife to my sweet love.\\n\\n  _Friar Laurence._ Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent\\n  To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.                           90\\n  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\\n  Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\n  Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\\n  And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\\n  When presently through all thy veins shall run\\n  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse\\n  Shall keep his native progress but surcease.\\n  No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\\n  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\n  To paly ashes, thy eyes\\' windows fall,                           100\\n  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;\\n  Each part, depriv\\'d of supple government,\\n  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\\n  And in this borrow\\'d likeness of shrunk death\\n  Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,\\n  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\n  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\n  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\n  Then, as the manner of our country is,\\n  In thy best robes uncover\\'d on the bier                          110\\n  Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\n  Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\n  In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\\n  Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\\n  And hither shall he come; and he and I\\n  Will watch thy waking, and that very night\\n  Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\n  And this shall free thee from this present shame,\\n  If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\n  Abate thy valour in the acting it.                               120\\n\\n  _Juliet._ Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\\n\\n  _Friar Laurence._ Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\n  In this resolve. I\\'ll send a friar with speed\\n  To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\n\\n  _Juliet._ Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\\n  Farewell, dear father!

The one is matter of rule, the other of taste\\nand feeling. Music is not an absolute necessity of verse; the metrical\\nform is a necessity, being that which constitutes the verse.\\n\\nThe plays of Shakespeare (with the exception of rhymed passages, and of\\noccasional songs and interludes) are all in unrhymed or _blank_ verse;\\nand the normal form of this blank verse is illustrated by the second\\nline of the prologue to the present play: \"In fair Verona, where we lay\\nour scene.\"\\n\\nThis line, it will be seen, consists of ten syllables, with the even\\nsyllables (2d, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th) accented, the odd syllables\\n(1st, 3d, etc.) being unaccented. Theoretically, it is made up of five\\n_feet_ of two syllables each, with the accent on the second syllable.\\nSuch a foot is called an _iambus_ (plural, _iambuses_, or the Latin\\n_iambi_), and the form of verse is called _iambic_.\\n\\nThis fundamental law of Shakespeare\\'s verse is subject to certain\\nmodifications, the most important of which are as follows:--\\n\\n1. After the tenth syllable an unaccented syllable (or even two such\\nsyllables) may be added, forming what is sometimes called a _female_\\nline; as in the 103d line of the first scene: \"Here were the servants of\\nyour adversary.\" The rhythm is complete with the third syllable of\\n_adversary_, the fourth being an extra eleventh syllable. In iv. 3. 27\\nand v. 3. 256 we have two extra syllables,--the last two of _Romeo_ in\\nboth lines.\\n\\n2. The accent in any part of the verse may be shifted from an even to an\\nodd syllable; as in line 3 of the prologue, \"From ancient grudge break\\nto new mutiny,\" where the accent is shifted from the sixth to the fifth\\nsyllable. See also i. 1. 92: \"Canker\\'d with peace, to part your canker\\'d\\nhate;\" where the accent is shifted from the second to the first\\nsyllable. This change occurs very rarely in the tenth syllable, and\\nseldom in the fourth; and it is not allowable in two successive accented\\nsyllables.\\n\\n3. An extra unaccented syllable may occur in any part of the line; as in\\nline 7 of the prologue, where the second syllable of _piteous_ is\\nsuperfluous. In i. 1. 64 the third syllable of _Benvolio_, and in line\\n71 below the second syllable of _Capulets_ and the second _the_ are both\\nsuperfluous.\\n\\n4. Any unaccented syllable, occurring in an even place immediately\\nbefore or after an even syllable which is properly accented, is reckoned\\nas accented for the purposes of the verse; as, for instance, in lines 1,\\n3, and 7 of the prologue. In 1 the last syllable of _dignity_ and in 3\\nthe last of _mutiny_ are metrically equivalent to accented syllables. In\\n7 the same is true of the first syllable of _misadventur\\'d_ and the\\nthird of _overthrows_. In iv. 2. 18 (\"Of disobedient opposition\") only\\ntwo regular accents occur, but we have a metrical accent on the first\\nsyllable of _disobedient_, and on the first and the last syllables of\\n_opposition_, which word has metrically five syllables. In _disobedient_\\nthere is an extra unaccented syllable.\\n\\n5. In many instances in Shakespeare words must be _lengthened_ in order\\nto fill out the rhythm:--\\n\\n(_a_) In a large class of words in which _e_ or _i_ is followed by\\nanother vowel, the _e_ or _i_ is made a separate syllable; as _ocean_,\\n_opinion_, _soldier_, _patience_, _partial_, _marriage_, etc. For\\ninstance, iii. 5. 29 (\"Some say the lark makes sweet division\") appears\\nto have only nine syllables, but _division_ is a quadrisyllable; and so\\nis _devotion_ in iv. 1. 41: \"God shield I should disturb devotion!\"\\n_Marriage_ is a trisyllable in iv. 1. 11, and also in v. 3. 241; and the\\nsame is true of _patience_ in v. 1. 27 v. 1. 27, v. 3. 221 and 261. This\\nlengthening occurs most frequently at the end of the line.\\n\\n(_b_) Many monosyllables ending in _r_, _re_, _rs_, _res_, preceded by a\\nlong vowel or diphthong, are often made dissyllables; as _fare_, _fear_,\\n_dear_, _fire_, _hair_, _hour_, _your_, etc. In iii. 1. 198: \"Else, when\\nhe\\'s found, that hour is his last,\" _hour_ is a dissyllable. If the word\\nis repeated in a verse it is often both monosyllable and dissyllable; as\\nin _M. of V._ iii. 2. 20: \"And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it\\nso,\" where either _yours_ (preferably the first) is a dissyllable, the\\nother being a monosyllable. In _J.C._ iii. 1. 172: \"As fire drives fire,\\nso pity, pity,\" the first _fire_ is a dissyllable.\\n\\n(_c_) Words containing _l_ or _r_, preceded by another consonant, are\\noften pronounced as if a vowel came between the consonants; as in i. 4.\\n8: \"After the prompter, at our entrance\" [ent(e)rance]. See also _T. of\\nS._ ii. 1. 158: \"While she did call me rascal fiddler\" [fidd(e)ler];\\n_All\\'s Well_, iii. 5. 43: \"If you will tarry, holy pilgrim\"\\n[pilg(e)rim]; _C. of E._ v. 1. 360: \"These are the parents of these\\nchildren\" (childeren, the original form of the word); _W.T._ iv. 4. 76:\\n\"Grace and remembrance [rememb(e)rance] be to you both!\" etc. See also\\non ii. 4. 184 and iii. 1. 89 below.\\n\\n(_d_) Monosyllabic exclamations (_ay_, _O_, _yea_, _nay_, _hail_, etc.)\\nand monosyllables otherwise emphasized are similarly lengthened; also\\ncertain longer words; as _commandement_ in _M. of V._ iv. 1. 442;\\n_safety_ (trisyllable) in _Ham_. i. 3. 21; _business_ (trisyllable, as\\noriginally pronounced) in _J.C._ iv. 1. 22: \"To groan and sweat under\\nthe business\" (so in several other passages); and other words mentioned\\nin the notes to the plays in which they occur.\\n\\n6. Words are also _contracted_ for metrical reasons, like plurals and\\npossessives ending in a sibilant, as _balance_, _horse_ (for _horses_\\nand _horse\\'s_), _princess_, _sense_, _marriage_ (plural and possessive),\\n_image_, etc. So _spirit_, _inter\\'gatories_, _unpleasant\\'st_, and other\\nwords mentioned in the notes on the plays.\\n\\n7. The _accent_ of words is also varied in many instances for metrical\\nreasons. Thus we find both _rÃ©venue_ and _revÃ©nue_ in the first scene of\\nthe _M.N.D._ (lines 6 and 158), _Ã³bscure_ and _obscÃºre_, _pÃºrsue_ and\\n_pursÃºe_, _cÃ³ntrary_ (see note on iii. 2. 64) and _contrÃ¡ry_, _contrÃ¡ct_\\n(see on ii. 2. 117) and _cÃ³ntract_, etc.\\n\\nThese instances of variable accent must not be confounded with those in\\nwhich words were uniformly accented differently in the time of\\nShakespeare; like _aspÃ©ct_, _impÃ³rtune_ (see on i. 1. 142), _persÃ©ver_\\n(never _persevÃ©re_), _persÃ©verance_, _rheÃºmatic_, etc.\\n\\n8. _Alexandrines_, or verses of twelve syllables, with six accents,\\noccur here and there; as in the inscriptions on the caskets in _M. of\\nV._, and occasionally in this play. They must not be confounded with\\nfemale lines with two extra syllables (see on 1 above) or with other\\nlines in which two extra unaccented syllables may occur.\\n\\n9. _Incomplete_ verses, of one or more syllables, are scattered through\\nthe plays. See i. 1. 61, 69, 162, 163, 164, 198, etc.\\n\\n10. _Doggerel_ measure is used in the very earliest comedies (_L. L. L._\\nand _C. of E._ in particular) in the mouths of comic characters, but\\nnowhere else in those plays, and never anywhere after 1597 or 1598.\\nThere is no instance of it in this play.\\n\\n11. _Rhyme_ occurs frequently in the early plays, but diminishes with\\ncomparative regularity from that period until the latest. Thus, in\\n_L. L. L._ there are about 1100 rhyming verses (about one-third of the\\nwhole number), in the _M.N.D._ about 900, and in _Rich. II._ about 500,\\nwhile in _Cor._ and _A. and C._ there are only about 40 each, in the\\n_Temp._ only two, and in the _W.T._ none at all, except in the chorus\\nintroducing act iv. Songs, interludes, and other matter not in\\nten-syllable measure are not included in this enumeration. In the\\npresent play, out of about 2500 ten-syllable verses, nearly 500 are in\\nrhyme.\\n\\n_Alternate_ rhymes are found only in the plays written before 1599 or\\n1600. In the _M. of V._ there are only four lines at the end of iii. 2.\\nIn _Much Ado_ and _A.Y.L._, we also find a few lines, but none at all in\\nsubsequent plays. Examples in this play are the prologue, the chorus at\\nthe beginning of act ii., and the last speech of act. v. See also\\npassages in i. 2, i. 5, and v. 3.\\n\\n_Rhymed couplets_ or \"rhyme-tags\" are often found at the end of scenes;\\nas in the first scene, and eleven other scenes, of the present play. In\\n_Ham._ 14 out of 20 scenes, and in _Macb._ 21 out of 28, have such\\n\"tags\"; but in the latest plays they are not so frequent. The _Temp_.,\\nfor instance, has but one, and the _W.T._ none.\\n\\n12. In this edition of Shakespeare, the final _-ed_ of past tenses and\\nparticiples is printed _-\\'d_ when the word is to be pronounced in the\\nordinary way; as in _star-cross\\'d_, line 6, and _misadventur\\'d_, line 7,\\nof the prologue. But when the metre requires that the _-ed_ be made a\\nseparate syllable, the _e_ is retained; as in _moved_, line 85, of the\\nfirst scene, where the word is a dissyllable. The only variation from\\nthis rule is in verbs like _cry_, _die_, _sue_, etc., the _-ed_ of which\\nis very rarely made a separate syllable.\\n\\nSHAKESPEARE\\'S USE OF VERSE AND PROSE IN THE PLAYS.--This is a subject to\\nwhich the critics have given very little attention, but it is an\\ninteresting study. In this play we find scenes entirely in verse (none\\nentirely in prose) and others in which the two are mixed. In general, we\\nmay say that verse is used for what is distinctly poetical, and prose\\nfor what is not poetical. The distinction, however, is not so clearly\\nmarked in the earlier as in the later plays. The second scene of the _M.\\nof V._, for instance, is in prose, because Portia and Nerissa are\\ntalking about the suitors in a familiar and playful way; but in the\\n_T.G. of V._, where Julia and Lucetta are discussing the suitors of the\\nformer in much the same fashion, the scene is in verse. Dowden,\\ncommenting on _Rich. II._, remarks: \"Had Shakespeare written the play a\\nfew years later, we may be certain that the gardener and his servants\\n(iii. 4) would not have uttered stately speeches in verse, but would\\nhave spoken homely prose, and that humour would have mingled with the\\npathos of the scene. The same remark may be made with reference to the\\nsubsequent scene (v. 5) in which his groom visits the dethroned king in\\nthe Tower.\" Comic characters and those in low life generally speak in\\nprose in the later plays, as Dowden intimates, but in the very earliest\\nones doggerel verse is much used instead. See on 10 above.\\n\\nThe change from prose to verse is well illustrated in the third scene of\\nthe _M. of V._ It begins with plain prosaic talk about a business\\nmatter; but when Antonio enters, it rises at once to the higher level of\\npoetry. The sight of Antonio reminds Shylock of his hatred of the\\nMerchant, and the passion expresses itself in verse, the vernacular\\ntongue of poetry. We have a similar change in the first scene of _J.C._,\\nwhere, after the quibbling \"chaff\" of the mechanics about their trades,\\nthe mention of Pompey reminds the Tribune of their plebeian fickleness,\\nand his scorn and indignation flame out in most eloquent verse.\\n\\nThe reasons for the choice of prose or verse are not always so clear as\\nin these instances. We are seldom puzzled to explain the prose, but not\\nunfrequently we meet with verse where we might expect prose. As\\nProfessor Corson remarks (_Introduction to Shakespeare_, 1889),\\n\"Shakespeare adopted verse as the general tenor of his language, and\\ntherefore expressed much in verse that is within the capabilities of\\nprose; in other words, his verse constantly encroaches upon the domain\\nof prose, but his prose can never be said to encroach upon the domain of\\nverse.\" If in rare instances we think we find exceptions to this latter\\nstatement, and prose actually seems to usurp the place of verse, I\\nbelieve that careful study of the passage will prove the supposed\\nexception to be apparent rather than real.\\n\\nSOME BOOKS FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.--A few out of the many books that\\nmight be commended to the teacher and the critical student are the\\nfollowing: Halliwell-Phillipps\\'s _Outlines of the Life of Shakespeare_\\n(7th ed. 1887); Sidney Lee\\'s _Life of Shakespeare_ (1898; for ordinary\\nstudents the abridged ed. of 1899 is preferable); Schmidt\\'s _Shakespeare\\nLexicon_ (3d ed. 1902); Littledale\\'s ed. of Dyce\\'s _Glossary_ (1902);\\nBartlett\\'s _Concordance to Shakespeare_ (1895); Abbott\\'s _Shakespearian\\nGrammar_ (1873); Furness\\'s \"New Variorum\" ed. of _Romeo and Juliet_\\n(1871; encyclopÃ¦dic and exhaustive); Dowden\\'s _Shakspere: His Mind and\\nArt_ (American ed. 1881); Hudson\\'s _Life, Art, and Characters of\\nShakespeare_ (revised ed. 1882); Mrs. Jameson\\'s _Characteristics of\\nWomen_ (several eds., some with the title, _Shakespeare Heroines_); Ten\\nBrink\\'s _Five Lectures on Shakespeare_ (1895); Boas\\'s _Shakespeare and\\nHis Predecessors_ (1895); Dyer\\'s _Folk-lore of Shakespeare_ (American\\ned. 1884); Gervinus\\'s _Shakespeare Commentaries_ (Bunnett\\'s translation,\\n1875); Wordsworth\\'s Shakespeare\\'s _Knowledge of the Bible_ (3d ed.\\n1880); Elson\\'s _Shakespeare in Music_ (1901).\\n\\nSome of the above books will be useful to all readers who are interested\\nin special subjects or in general criticism of Shakespeare. Among those\\nwhich are better suited to the needs of ordinary readers and students,\\nthe following may be mentioned: Mabie\\'s _William Shakespeare: Poet,\\nDramatist, and Man_ (1900); Phin\\'s _CyclopÃ¦dia and Glossary of\\nShakespeare_ (1902; more compact and cheaper than Dyce); Dowden\\'s\\n_Shakspere Primer_ (1877; small but invaluable); Rolfe\\'s _Shakespeare\\nthe Boy_ (1896; treating of the home and school life, the games and\\nsports, the manners, customs, and folk-lore of the poet\\'s time);\\nGuerber\\'s _Myths of Greece and Rome_ (for young students who may need\\ninformation on mythological allusions not explained in the notes).\\n\\nBlack\\'s _Judith Shakespeare_ (1884; a novel, but a careful study of the\\nscene and the time) is a book that I always commend to young people, and\\ntheir elders will also enjoy it. The Lambs\\' _Tales from Shakespeare_ is\\na classic for beginners in the study of the dramatist; and in Rolfe\\'s\\ned. the plan of the authors is carried out in the Notes by copious\\nillustrative quotations from the plays. Mrs. Cowden-Clarke\\'s _Girlhood\\nof Shakespeare\\'s Heroines_ (several eds.) will particularly interest\\ngirls; and both girls and boys will find Bennett\\'s _Master Skylark_\\n(1897) and Imogen Clark\\'s _Will Shakespeare\\'s Little Lad_ (1897) equally\\nentertaining and instructive.\\n\\nH. Snowden Ward\\'s _Shakespeare\\'s Town and Times_ (2d ed. 1903) and John\\nLeyland\\'s _Shakespeare Country_ (enlarged ed. 1903) are copiously\\nillustrated books (yet inexpensive) which may be particularly commended\\nfor school libraries.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS IN THE NOTES.--The abbreviations of the names of\\nShakespeare\\'s plays will be readily understood; as _T.N._ for _Twelfth\\nNight_, _Cor._ for _Coriolanus_, _3 Hen. VI._ for _The Third Part of\\nKing Henry the Sixth_, etc. _P.P._ refers to _The Passionate Pilgrim_;\\n_V. and A._ to _Venus and Adonis_; _L.C._ to _Lover\\'s Complaint_; and\\nSonn. to the _Sonnets_.\\n\\nOther abbreviations that hardly need explanation are _Cf._ (_confer_,\\ncompare), _Fol._ (following), _Id._ (_idem_, the same), and _Prol._\\n(prologue). The numbers of the lines in the references (except for the\\npresent play) are those of the \"Globe\" edition (the cheapest and best\\nedition of _Shakespeare_ in one compact volume), which is now generally\\naccepted as the standard for line-numbers in works of reference\\n(Schmidt\\'s _Lexicon_, Abbott\\'s _Grammar_, Dowden\\'s _Primer_, the\\npublications of the New Shakspere Society, etc.). Every teacher and\\nevery critical student should have it at hand for reference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE\\n\\n\\n_Enter Chorus._ As Malone suggests, this probably meant only that the\\nprologue was to be spoken by the same actor that personated the chorus\\nat the end of act i. The prologue is omitted in the folio, but we cannot\\ndoubt that it was written by S. It is in form a sonnet, of the pattern\\nadopted in his _Sonnets_. See comments upon it, p. 22 above.\\n\\n2. _Fair Verona._ The city is thus described in the opening lines of\\nBrooke\\'s poem:[4]--\\n\\n  \"There is beyonde the Alps, a towne of auncient fame\\n  Whose bright renoune yet shineth cleare, Verona men it name:\\n  Bylt in an happy time, bylt on a fertile soyle:\\n  Maynteined by the heauenly fates, and by the townish toyle.\\n  The fruitefull hilles aboue, the pleasant vales belowe,\\n  The siluer streame with chanell depe, that through the towne doth flow:\\n  The store of springes that serue for vse, and eke for ease:\\n  And other moe commodities, which profite may and please;\\n  Eke many certaine signes of thinges betyde of olde,\\n  To fyll the houngry eyes of those that curiously beholde:\\n  Doe make this towne to be preferde aboue the rest\\n  Of Lumbard townes, or at the least compared with the best.\"\\n\\n6. _Star-cross\\'d._ For the astrological allusion, cf. i. 4. 104, v. 1.\\n24, and v. 3. 111 below. The title of one of Richard Braithwaite\\'s\\nworks, published in 1615, is \"Love\\'s Labyrinth: or the True Lover\\'s\\nKnot, including the disastrous falls of two Star-crost lovers Pyramus\\nand Thisbe.\"\\n\\n8. _Doth._ The reading of the quartos, changed by most of the modern\\neditors to \"Do.\" Ulrici considers it the old third person plural in\\n-_th_. He adds that S. mostly uses it only where it has the force of\\nthe singular, namely, where the sense is collective, as in _overthrows_\\nhere. Cf. v. 1. 70 below.\\n\\n12. _Two hours._ Cf. _Hen. VIII._ prol. 13: \"may see away their shilling\\nRichly in two short hours.\"\\n\\n[Footnote 4: The entire poem is reprinted in the _Variorum_ of 1821, in\\nCollier\\'s _Shakespeare\\'s Library_ (and Hazlitt\\'s revised ed. of the\\nsame), in Halliwell-Phillipps\\'s folio ed. of Shakespeare, and by the New\\nShakspere Society (edited by P.A. Daniel) in 1875. I have followed\\nDaniel\\'s ed.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT I\\n\\n\\nSCENE I.--1. _Carry coals._ \"Endure affronts\" (Johnson). According to\\nNares, the phrase got this meaning from the fact that the carriers of\\nwood and coals were esteemed the very lowest of menials. Cf. _Hen. V._\\niii. 2. 49, where there is a play upon the expression. Steevens quotes\\nNash, _Have With You_, etc.: \"We will bear no coles, I warrant you;\"\\nMarston, _Antonio and Mellida_, part ii.: \"He has had wrongs; and if I\\nwere he I would bear no coles,\" etc. Dyce cites Cotgrave, _Fr. Dict._:\\n\"_Il a du feu en la teste_. Hee is very chollericke, furious, or\\ncouragious; he will carrie no coales.\" He might have added from\\nSherwood\\'s English-French supplement to Cotgrave (ed. 1632): \"That will\\ncarrie no coales, _Brave_.\"\\n\\n3. _Colliers._ The preceding note explains how _colliers_ came to be a\\nterm of abuse. The _New Eng. Dict._ adds that it may have been due to\\n\"the evil repute of the collier for cheating.\" Steevens compares _T.N._\\niii. 4. 130: \"hang him, foul collier!\"\\n\\n4. _Choler._ For the play upon the word, cf. Jonson, _Every Man in his\\nHumour_, iii. 2:--\\n\\n     \"_Cash._ Why, how now, Cob? what moves thee to this cholar, ha?\\n\\n     _Cob._ Collar, master Thomas? I scorn your collar, I sir; I am none\\n     of your cart-horse, though I carry and draw water.\"\\n\\n15. _Take the wall._ Claim the right of passing next the wall when\\nmeeting a person on the street; a right valued in old-fashioned streets\\nwith narrow sidewalks or none at all. To _give the wall_ was an act of\\ncourtesy; to _take the wall_ might be an insult.\\n\\n17. _The weakest goes to the wall._ A familiar proverb.\\n\\n28. _Here comes two_, etc. Halliwell-Phillipps remarks that the\\npartisans of the Montagues wore a token in their hats to distinguish\\nthem from the Capulets; hence throughout the play they are known at a\\ndistance. Cf. Gascoigne, _Devise of a Masque, written for Viscount\\nMontacute_, 1575:--\\n\\n  \"And for a further proofe, he shewed in hys hat\\n  Thys token which the _Mountacutes_ did beare alwaies, for that\\n  They covet to be knowne from _Capels_, where they pass,\\n  For ancient grutch whych long ago \\'tweene these two houses was.\"\\n\\n39. _I will bite my thumb at them._ An insult explained by Cotgrave,\\n_Fr. Dict._ (ed. 1632): \"_Nique, faire la nique_, to threaten or defie,\\nby putting the thumbe naile into the mouth, and with a ierke (from th\\'\\nupper teeth) make it to knocke.\"\\n\\n44. _Of our side._ On our side (_on = of_, as often).\\n\\n55. _Here comes one_, etc. \"Gregory may mean Tybalt, who enters directly\\nafter Benvolio, but on a different part of the stage. The eyes of the\\nservant may be directed the way he sees Tybalt coming, and in the mean\\ntime Benvolio enters on the opposite side\" (Steevens).\\n\\n60. _Swashing blow._ A dashing or smashing blow (Schmidt). Cf. Jonson,\\n_Staple of News_, v. 1: \"I do confess a swashing blow.\" Cf. also _swash_\\n= bully, bluster; as in _A.Y.L._ i. 3. 122: \"I\\'ll have a martial and a\\nswashing outside.\"\\n\\n63. _Art thou drawn?_ Cf. _Temp._ ii. 1. 308: \"Why are you drawn?\"\\n_Heartless_ = cowardly, spiritless; as in _R. of L._ 471, 1392.\\n\\n69. _Have at thee._ Cf. iv. 5. 119 below; also _C. of E._ iii. 1. 51,\\netc.\\n\\n70. _Clubs._ The cry of _Clubs_! in a street affray is of English\\norigin, as the _bite my thumb_ is of Italian. It was the rallying-cry of\\nthe London apprentices. Cf. _Hen. VIII._ v. 4. 53, _A.Y.L._ v. 2. 44,\\netc. _Bills_ were the pikes or halberds formerly carried by the English\\ninfantry and afterwards by watchmen. The _partisan_ was \"a sharp\\ntwo-edged sword placed on the summit of a staff for the defence of\\nfoot-soldiers against cavalry\" (Fairholt). Cf. _Ham._ i. 1. 140: \"Shall\\nI strike at it with my partisan?\"\\n\\n71. _Enter_ CAPULET _in his gown_. Cf. _Ham._ (quarto) iii. 4. 61:\\n\"_Enter the ghost in his night gowne_;\" that is, his dressing-gown. See\\nalso _Macb._ ii. 2. 70: \"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us\\nAnd show us to be watchers;\" and _Id._ v. 1. 5: \"I have seen her rise\\nfrom her bed, throw her nightgown upon her,\" etc. It is early morning,\\nand Capulet comes out before he is dressed.\\n\\n72. _Long sword._ The weapon used in active warfare; a lighter and\\nshorter one being worn for ornament (see _A.W._ ii. 1. 32: \"no sword\\nworn But one to dance with\"). Cf. _M.W._ ii. 1. 236: \"with my long sword\\nI would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.\"\\n\\n73. _A crutch, a crutch!_ The lady\\'s sneer at her aged husband. For her\\nown age, see on i. 3. 51 below.\\n\\n75. _In spite._ In scornful defiance. Cf. 3 _Hen. VI._ i. 3. 158,\\n_Cymb._ iv. 1. 16, etc.\\n\\n79. _Neighbour-stained._ Because used in civil strife.\\n\\n84. _Mistemper\\'d._ Tempered to an ill end (Schmidt). Steevens explains\\nit as = angry. The word occurs again in _K. John_, v. 1. 12: \"This\\ninundation of mistemper\\'d humour.\"\\n\\n85. _Moved._ That is, \"mov\\'d to wrath\" (_T.A._ i. 1. 419). Cf. _L. L. L._\\nv. 2. 694, _J.C._ iv. 3. 58, etc.\\n\\n89. _Ancient._ Not of necessity old in years, but long settled there and\\naccustomed to peace and order (Delius).\\n\\n90. _Grave beseeming_. Grave and becoming. Cf. _Ham._ iv. 7. 79:--\\n\\n          \"for youth no less becomes\\n  The light and careless livery that it wears,\\n  Than settled age his sables and his weeds,\\n  Importing health and graveness.\"\\n\\n92. _Canker\\'d with peace_, etc. _Canker\\'d_ (= corroded) is applied\\nliterally to the partisans long disused, and figuratively to their\\nowners. Cf. _K. John_, ii. 1. 194: \"A canker\\'d grandam\\'s will.\"\\n\\n99. _Freetown._ S. takes the name from Brooke\\'s poem. It translates the\\n_Villa Franca_ of the Italian story.\\n\\n101. S. uses _set abroach_ only in a bad sense. Cf. 2 _Hen. IV._ iv. 2.\\n14: \"Alack, what mischiefs might be set abroach;\" and _Rich. III._ i. 3.\\n325: \"The secret mischiefs that I set abroach.\"\\n\\n109. _Nothing hurt withal._ Nowise harmed by it. _Who_ = which; as\\noften.\\n\\n110. _While we_, etc. This line, with the change of _we_ to _they_, is\\nfound in the 1st quarto in iii. 1, where Benvolio describes the brawl in\\nwhich Mercutio and Tybalt are slain (Daniel).\\n\\n113. _Saw you him to-day?_ This use of the past tense is not allowable\\nnow, but was common in Elizabethan English. Cf. _Cymb._ iv. 2. 66: \"I\\nsaw him not these many years,\" etc.\\n\\n115. _The worshipp\\'d sun._ Cf. iii. 2. 25 below: \"And pay no worship to\\nthe garish sun.\" See also _Lear_, i. 1. 111: \"the sacred radiance of the\\nsun;\" and _Cymb._ iv. 4. 41: \"the holy sun.\" It is remarkable that no\\nGerman commentator has tried to make S. a Parsee.\\n\\n116. _Forth._ Cf. _M.N.D._ i. 1. 164: \"Steal forth thy father\\'s house,\"\\netc.\\n\\n118. _Sycamore._ According to Beisly and Ellacombe, the _Acer\\npseudo-platanus_, which grows wild in Italy. It had been introduced into\\nEngland before the time of S. He mentions it also in _L. L. L._ v. 2. 89\\nand _Oth._ iv. 3. 41.\\n\\n119. _Rooteth._ Cf. _W.T._ i. 1. 25: \"there rooted betwixt them such an\\naffection,\" etc.\\n\\n121. _Ware._ Aware; but not to be printed as a contraction of that word.\\nCf. ii. 2. 103 below.\\n\\n123. _Affections._ Feelings, inclinations. Cf. _Ham._ iii. 1. 170:\\n\"Love! his affections do not that way tend,\" etc.\\n\\n124. _Which then_, etc. \"The plain meaning seems to be that Benvolio,\\nlike Romeo, was indisposed for society, and sought to be most where most\\npeople were not to be found, being one too many, even when by himself\"\\n(Collier). Some editors follow Pope in reading (from 1st quarto) \"That\\nmost are busied when they\\'re most alone.\"\\n\\n127. _Who._ Him who; the antecedent omitted, as often when it is easily\\nsupplied.\\n\\n131. _All so soon. All_ is often used in this \"intensive\" way.\\n\\n134. _Heavy._ S. is fond of playing on _heavy_ and _light._ Cf. _R. of\\nL._ 1574, _T.G. of V._ i. 2. 84, _M. of V._ v. 1. 130, etc.\\n\\n142. _Importun\\'d._ Accented on the second syllable, as regularly in S.\\n\\n148. _With._ By; as often of the agent or cause.\\n\\n150. _Sun._ The early eds. all have \"same.\" The emendation is due to\\nTheobald and is almost universally adopted.\\n\\n156. _To hear._ _As_ to hear; a common ellipsis.\\n\\n157. _Is the day so young?_ Is it not yet noon? _Good morrow_ or _good\\nday_ was considered proper only before noon, after which _good den_ was\\nthe usual salutation. Cf. i. 2. 57 below.\\n\\n158. _New._ Often used by S. in this adverbial way = just, lately. Cf.\\nv. 3. 197 below. For _Ay me!_ see on ii. 1. 10.\\n\\n166. _In his view._ In appearance; opposed to _proof_ = experience. Cf.\\n_Ham._ iii. 2. 179: \"What my love is, proof hath made you know,\" etc.\\n\\n168. _Alas, that love, whose view_, etc. Alas \"that love, though\\nblindfolded, should see how to reach the lover\\'s heart\" (Dowden). _View_\\nhere = sight, or eyes.\\n\\n172. _Here\\'s much_, etc. Romeo means that the fray has much to do with\\nthe hate between the rival houses, yet affects him more, inasmuch as his\\nRosaline is of the Capulet family.\\n\\n173-178. _O brawling love!_ etc. Cf. iii. 2. 73 fol. below.\\n\\n187. _Rais\\'d._ The reading of the 1st quarto, adopted by the majority of\\neditors. The other early eds. have \"made.\"\\n\\n188. _Purg\\'d._ That is, from smoke.\\n\\n191. _A choking gall_, etc. That is, \"love kills and keeps alive, is a\\nbane and an antidote\" (Dowden).\\n\\n195. _Some other where._ Cf. _C. of E._ iv. 1. 30: \"How if your husband\\nstart some other where?\"\\n\\n196. _Sadness._ Seriousness. Cf. _A.W._ iv. 3. 230: \"In good sadness, I\\ndo not know,\" etc. So _sadly_ just below = seriously, as in _Much Ado_,\\nii. 3. 229.\\n\\n203. _Mark-man._ The 3d and 4th folios have \"marks-man.\" S. uses the\\nword nowhere else.\\n\\n206. _Dian\\'s wit._ Her way of thinking, her sentiments. S. has many\\nallusions to Diana\\'s chastity, and also to her connection with the moon.\\n\\n207. _Proof._ Used technically of armour. Cf. _Rich. II._ i. 3. 73: \"Add\\nproof unto mine armour with thy prayers;\" _Ham._ ii. 2. 512: \"Mars\\'s\\narmour forg\\'d for proof eterne,\" etc.\\n\\n209. _The siege_, etc. Cf. _V. and A._ 423:--\\n\\n  \"Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;\\n  To love\\'s alarm it will not ope the gate.\"\\n\\nSee also _R. of L._ 221, _A.W._ iii. 7. 18, _Cymb._ iii. 4. 137, etc.\\n\\n213. _That when she dies_, etc. \"_She is rich in beauty_, and _only\\npoor_ in being subject to the lot of humanity, that _her store_, or\\nriches, _can be destroyed by death_, who shall, by the same blow, put an\\nend to beauty\" (Johnson); or, as Mason puts it, \"she is poor because she\\nleaves no part of her store behind her.\" _Her store_ may mean \"beauty\\'s\\nstore,\" as Dowden suggests. Cf. _V. and A._ 1019: \"For he, being dead,\\nwith him is beauty slain.\"\\n\\n215. _In that sparing makes huge waste._ Cf. _Sonn._ 1. 12: \"And, tender\\nchurl, makes waste in niggarding.\"\\n\\n216. _Starv\\'d._ The early eds. (except the 4th folio) have \"sterv\\'d,\"\\nthe old form of the word, found in several other passages in the folio\\n(_M. of V._ iv. 1. 138, _Cor._ iv. 2. 51, etc.) and rhyming with\\n_deserve_ in _Cor._ ii. 3. 120. Cf. Spenser, _F.Q._ iv. 1. 4:--\\n\\n  \"Untill such time as noble Britomart\\n  Released her, that else was like to sterve\\n  Through cruell knife that her deare heart did kerve.\"\\nThere it means to die (its original sense), as in _Hen. VII._ v. 3. 132.\\n\\n226. _To call hers, exquisite._ \"That is, to call hers, which is\\nexquisite, the more into my remembrance and contemplation\" (Heath); or\\n\"to make her unparalleled beauty more the subject of thought and\\nconversation\" (Malone). For _question_ = conversation, cf. _A.Y.L._ iii.\\n4. 39, v. 4. 167, etc. But why may not _question_ repeat the idea of\\n_examine_? Benvolio says, \"Examine other beauties;\" Romeo replies, in\\nsubstance, that the result of the examination will only be to prove her\\nbeauty superior to theirs and therefore the more extraordinary.\\n\\n227. _These happy masks._ Steevens took this to refer to \"the masks worn\\nby female spectators of the play;\" but it is probably = the masks worn\\nnowadays. They are called _happy_ as \"being privileged to touch the\\nsweet countenances beneath\" (Clarke).\\n\\n229. _Strucken._ The early eds. have \"strucken\" or \"strooken.\" S. also\\nuses _struck_ (or _strook_) and _stricken_ as the participle.\\n\\n231. _Passing._ Often used adverbially but only before adjectives and\\nadverbs. Cf. _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 103, _Much Ado_, ii. 1. 84, etc.\\n\\n235. _Pay that doctrine._ Give that instruction. Cf. _L. L. L._ iv. 3.\\n350: \"From women\\'s eyes this doctrine I derive;\" _A. and C._ v. 2.\\n31:--\\n\\n          \"I hourly learn\\n  A doctrine of obedience,\" etc.\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.--4. _Reckoning._ Estimation, reputation.\\n\\n9. _Fourteen years._ In Brooke\\'s poem her father says, \"Scarce saw she\\nyet full xvi. yeres;\" and in Paynter\\'s novel \"as yet shee is not\\nattayned to the age of xviii. yeares.\"\\n\\n13. _Made._ The 1st quarto has \"maried,\" which is followed by some\\neditors. The antithesis of _make_ and _mar_ is a very common one in S.\\nCf. ii. 4. 110 below: \"that God hath made for himself to mar.\" See also\\n_L. L. L._ iv. 3. 191, _M.N.D._ i. 2. 39, _A.Y.L._ i. 1. 34, _T. of S._\\niv. 3. 97, _Macb._ ii. 3. 36, _Oth._ v. 1. 4, etc. On the other hand,\\nexamples of the opposition of _married_ and _marred_ are not uncommon\\nin Elizabethan writers. Cf. _A.W._ ii. 3. 315: \"A young man married is a\\nman that\\'s marr\\'d.\"\\n\\n14. _All my hopes but she._ Capulet seems to imply here that he has lost\\nsome children; but cf. iii. 5. 163 below.\\n\\n15. _My earth._ My world or my life; rather than my lands, my landed\\nproperty, as some explain it. It was apparently suggested by the _earth_\\nof the preceding line.\\n\\n17. _My will_, etc. My will is subordinate to her consent. The old man\\ntalks very differently in iii. 5 below.\\n\\n25. _Dark heaven._ The darkness of night. Cf. i. 5. 47 below.\\n\\n26. _Young men._ Malone compares _Sonn._ 98. 2:--\\n\\n  \"When proud-pied April dress\\'d in all his trim\\n  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing.\"\\n\\n29. _Female._ The quartos (except the 1st) and 1st folio have the\\ncurious misprint \"fennell.\"\\n\\n30. _Inherit._ Possess; as in _Temp._ iv. 1. 154, _Rich. II._ ii. 1. 83,\\n_Cymb._ iii. 2. 63, etc.\\n\\n32. _Which on more view_, etc. A perplexing line for which many\\nemendations have been suggested. With the reading in the text the\\nmeaning seems to be: _which one_ (referring to _her of most merit_),\\nafter your further inspection of the many, my daughter (who is one of\\nthe number) may prove to be,--one in number, though one is no number.\\nThe quibble at the end alludes to the old proverb that \"one is no\\nnumber.\" Cf. _Sonn._ 136. 8: \"Among a number one is reckon\\'d none.\"\\nDowden points thus: \"Which on more view of, many--mine being one--May,\"\\netc., and explains thus: \"On more view of whom (that is, the lady of\\nmost merit), many (other ladies)--and my daughter among them--may stand\\nin a count of heads, but in estimation (_reckoning_, with a play on the\\nword) none can hold a place.\" The general sense of the passage is clear,\\nwhatever reading or analysis we adopt. Capulet says in substance: Come\\nto my house to-night, and decide whom you like best of the beauties\\ngathered there; if Juliet be the one, well and good. He has already\\ntold Paris that she shall be his if he can gain her love, but discreetly\\nsuggests that he look more carefully at the \"fresh female buds\" of\\nVerona before plucking one to wear on his heart.\\n\\n36. _Written there._ Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"No Lady fayre or fowle was in Verona towne:\\n  No knight or gentleman of high or lowe renowne:\\n  But Capilet himselfe hath byd vnto his feast:\\n  Or by his name in paper sent, appoynted as a geast.\"\\n\\n46. _One fire_, etc. Alluding to the old proverb that \"fire drives out\\nfire.\" Cf. _J.C._ iii. 1. 171: \"As fire drives out fire, so pity pity;\"\\n_Cor._ iv. 7. 54: \"One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail,\"\\netc.\\n\\n48. _Holp._ Used by S. oftener than _helped_, for both the past tense\\nand the participle.\\n\\n49. _Cures with._ Is cured by. S. does not elsewhere use _cure_\\nintransitively. _Languish_ occurs again as a noun in _A. and C._ v. 2.\\n42: \"That rids our dogs of languish.\" On the passage cf. Brooke:--\\n\\n  \"Ere long the townishe dames together will resort:\\n  Some one of bewty, favour, shape, and of so lovely porte:\\n  With so fast fixed eye, perhaps thou mayst beholde:\\n  That thou shalt quite forget thy loue, and passions past of olde.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  The proverbe saith vnminded oft are they that are vnseene.\\n  And as out of a planke a nayle a nayle doth drive:\\n  So novell love out of the minde the auncient loue doth rive.\"\\n\\n52. _Your plantain-leaf._ The common plantain (_Plantago major_), which\\nstill holds a place in the domestic _materia medica_. For its use in\\nhealing bruises, cf. _L. L. L._ iii. 1. 74:--\\n\\n  \"_Moth._ A wonder, master! here\\'s a costard broken in a shin.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  _Costard._ O sir, plantain, a plain plantain! ... no salve, sir,\\n    but a plantain!\"\\n\\nSteevens quotes _Albumazar_: \"Bring a fresh plantain leaf, I\\'ve broke my\\nshin.\" _A broken shin_, like a _broken head_ (_M.W._ i. 125, _T.N._ v.\\n1. 178, etc.) is one that is bruised, so that the blood runs, not one\\nthat is fractured. The plantain was supposed to have other virtues.\\nHalliwell-Phillipps quotes Withals, _Little Dictionarie for Children_,\\n1586: \"The tode being smitten of the spyder in fighte, and made to swell\\nwith hir poyson, recovereth himselfe with plantaine.\"\\n\\n55. _Not mad, but bound_, etc. An allusion to the old-time treatment of\\nthe insane. Cf. _C. of E._ iv. 4. 97: \"They must be bound and laid in\\nsome dark room;\" and _A.Y.L._ iii. 2. 420: \"Love is merely a madness,\\nand, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do.\"\\n\\n57. _Good-den._ Printed \"godden\" and \"gooden\" in the early eds., and a\\ncorruption of _good e\\'en_, or _good evening_. _God gi\\' good-den_ in the\\nnext line is printed \"Godgigoden\" in the quartos and first three folios,\\n\"God gi\\' Good-e\\'en\" in the 4th folio. This salutation was used as soon\\nas noon was past. See on i. 1. 157 above, and cf. ii. 4. 105 fol. below.\\n\\n64. _Rest you merry!_ For the full form, _God rest you merry_! (= God\\nkeep you merry), cf. _A.Y.L._ v. 1. 65, etc. It was a common form of\\nsalutation at meeting, and oftener at parting. Here the servant is about\\nto leave, thinking that Romeo is merely jesting with him. Cf. 79 below.\\n\\n66-69. _Signior Martino_, etc. Probably meant to be prose, but some\\neditors make bad verse of it.\\n\\n69. _Mercutio._ Mercutio here figures among the invited guests, although\\nwe find him always associating with the young men of the Montague\\nfamily. He is the prince\\'s \"kinsman,\" and apparently on terms of\\nacquaintance with both the rival houses, though more intimate with the\\nMontagues than with the Capulets.\\n\\n71. _Rosaline._ This shows that Rosaline is a Capulet.\\n\\n74. _Up._ Dowden plausibly prints \"Up--,\" assuming that \"Romeo eagerly\\ninterrupts the servant, who would have said \\'Up to our house.\\'\"\\n\\n82. _Crush a cup_, etc. A common expression in the old plays. We still\\nsay \"crack a bottle.\"\\n\\n87. _Unattainted._ Unprejudiced, impartial; used by S. only here.\\n\\n91. _Fires._ The early eds. have \"fire,\" which White retains as an\\nadmissible rhyme in Shakespeare\\'s day.\\n\\n92. _Who often drown\\'d_, etc. Alluding to the old notion that if a witch\\nwere thrown into the water she would not sink. King James, in his\\n_DÃ¦monology_, says: \"It appeares that God hath appointed for a\\nsupernatural signe of the monstrous impietie of witches, that the water\\nshall refuse to receive them in her bosom that have shaken off them the\\nsacred water of baptism, and wilfully refused the benefit thereof.\"\\n\\n98. _That crystal scales._ The reading of the early eds., changed by\\nsome to \"those,\" etc.; but _scales_ may be used for the entire machine.\\nDyce says it was often so used by writers of the time.\\n\\n99. _Lady\\'s love._ Some substitute \"lady-love,\" which S. does not use\\nelsewhere. Clarke suggests that _your lady\\'s love_ may mean \"the little\\nlove Rosaline bears you,\" weighed against that of some possible _maid_.\\n\\n101. _Scant._ Not elsewhere used adverbially by S. _Scantly_ occurs only\\nin _A. and C._ iii. 4. 6.\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.--1. On the character of the Nurse Mrs. Jameson says:--\\n\\n\"She is drawn with the most wonderful power and discrimination. In the\\nprosaic homeliness of the outline, and the magical illusion of the\\ncolouring, she reminds us of some of the marvellous Dutch paintings,\\nfrom which, with all their coarseness, we start back as from a reality.\\nHer low humour, her shallow garrulity, mixed with the dotage and\\npetulance of age--her subserviency, her secrecy, and her total want of\\nelevated principle, or even common honesty--are brought before us like a\\nliving and palpable truth....\\n\\n\"Among these harsh and inferior spirits is Juliet placed; her haughty\\nparents, and her plebeian nurse, not only throw into beautiful relief\\nher own native softness and elegance, but are at once the cause and the\\nexcuse of her subsequent conduct. She trembles before her stern mother\\nand her violent father, but, like a petted child, alternately cajoles\\nand commands her nurse. It is her old foster-mother who is the\\nconfidante of her love. It is the woman who cherished her infancy who\\naids and abets her in her clandestine marriage. Do we not perceive how\\nimmediately our impression of Juliet\\'s character would have been\\nlowered, if Shakespeare had placed her in connection with any\\ncommonplace dramatic waiting-woman?--even with Portia\\'s adroit Nerissa,\\nor Desdemona\\'s Emilia? By giving her the Nurse for her confidante, the\\nsweetness and dignity of Juliet\\'s character are preserved inviolate to\\nthe fancy, even in the midst of all the romance and wilfulness of\\npassion.\"\\n\\nCf. Coleridge: \"The character of the Nurse is the nearest of anything in\\nShakspeare to a direct borrowing from mere observation; and the reason\\nis, that as in infancy and childhood the individual in nature is a\\nrepresentative of a class--just as in describing one larch-tree, you\\ngeneralize a grove of them--so it is nearly as much so in old age. The\\ngeneralization is done to the poet\\'s hand. Here you have the garrulity\\nof age strengthened by the feelings of a long-trusted servant, whose\\nsympathy with the mother\\'s affections gives her privileges and rank in\\nthe household; and observe the mode of connection by accidents of time\\nand place, and the childlike fondness of repetition in a second\\nchildhood, and also that happy, humble ducking under, yet constant\\nresurgence against, the check of her superiors!\"\\n\\n2. _Maidenhead._ Etymologically the same word as _maidenhood_. So\\n_lustihead_ = lustihood, _livelihead_ = livelihood (as in Spenser,\\n_F.Q._ ii. 2. 2: \"for porcion of thy livelyhed\"), etc. Cf. _Godhead_,\\netc.\\n\\n4. _God forbid!_ Staunton suggests that the Nurse uses _lady-bird_ as a\\nterm of endearment; but, recollecting its application to a woman of\\nloose life, checks herself--_God forbid_ her darling should prove such a\\none! Dyce explains it: \"God forbid that any accident should keep her\\naway!\" This seems to me more probable.\\n\\n7. _Give leave awhile._ Leave us alone; a courteous form of dismissal.\\nCf. _T.G. of V._ iii. 1. 1: \"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;\"\\n_M.W._ ii. 2. 165: \"Give us leave, drawer,\" etc.\\n\\n9. _I have remember\\'d me._ For the reflexive use, cf. _1 Hen. IV._ ii.\\n4. 468: \"and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff,\" etc.\\n\\n_Thou\\'s._ Cf. _Lear_, iv. 6. 246. The early eds. have \"thou \\'se\"; most\\nmodern ones substitute \"thou shalt.\"\\n\\n12. _Lay._ Wager. Cf. _L. L. L._ i. 1. 310, _T. and C._ iii. 1. 95, etc.\\n\\n13. _Teen._ Sorrow; used here for the play on _fourteen_. Cf. _V. and\\nA._ 808: \"My face is full of shame, my heart of teen;\" _Temp._ i. 2. 64:\\n\"the teen I have turn\\'d you to;\" _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 164: \"Of sighs and\\ngroans, of sorrow and of teen,\" etc.\\n\\n15. _Lammas-tide._ The 1st of August. _Tide_ = time, as in _even-tide_,\\n_springtide_, etc. Cf. _K. John_, iii. 1. 86:--\\n\\n  \"What hath this day deserv\\'d? what hath it done,\\n  That it in golden letters should be set\\n  Among the high tides in the calendar?\"\\n\\nSee also the play upon the word in _T. of A._ i. 2. 57: \"Flow this way!\\nA brave fellow! he keeps his tides well.\"\\n\\n23. _The earthquake._ Tyrwhitt suggested that this may refer to the\\nearthquake felt in England on the 6th of April, 1580. Malone notes that\\nif the earthquake happened on the day when Juliet was _weaned_\\n(presumably when she was a year old), she could not well be more than\\n_twelve_ years old now; but the Nurse makes her almost _fourteen_--as\\nher father (i. 2. 9) and her mother (i. 3. 12) also do.\\n\\n26. _Wormwood._ Halliwell-Phillipps cites Cawdray, _Treasurie or\\nStorehouse of Similies_, 1600: \"if the mother put worme-wood or mustard\\nupon the breast, the child sucking it, and feeling the bitternesse, he\\nquite forsaketh it, without sucking any more,\" etc.\\n\\n27. _Sitting in the sun_, etc. Cf. Dame Quickly\\'s circumstantial\\nreminiscences, _2 Hen. IV._ ii. 1. 93 fol.: \"Thou didst swear to me,\"\\netc.\\n\\n29. _Bear a brain._ Have a brain, that is, a good memory.\\n\\n31. _Pretty fool._ On _fool_ as a term of endearment or pity, cf.\\n_A.Y.L._ ii. 1. 22, _Lear_, v. 2. 308, etc.\\n\\n32. _Tetchy._ Touchy, fretful. Cf. _Rich. III._ iv. 4. 168: \"Tetchy and\\nwayward was thy infancy.\"\\n\\n33. _Shake, quoth the dove-house._ The dove-house shook. It refers of\\ncourse to the effects of the earthquake. Daniel (in Dowden\\'s ed.) quotes\\nPeele, _Old Wives\\' Tale_: \"Bounce, quoth the guns;\" and Heywood, _Fair\\nMaid of the West_: \"Rouse, quoth the ship.\"\\n\\n36. _By the rood._ That is, by the cross; as in _Ham._ iii. 4. 14,\\n_Rich. III._ iii. 2. 77, etc. For _alone_ the 1st and 2d quartos have\\n\"high-lone,\" which Herford, Dowden, and some others adopt. \"It is an\\nalteration of _alone_, of obscure origin\" (_New Eng. Dict._) found in\\nMarston, Middleton, and other writers of the time. In George\\nWashington\\'s _Diary_ (1760) it is used of mares. According to the\\ndescription here, Juliet could not have been much more than a year old\\nat the time. See on 23 above.\\n\\n38. _Mark._ Appoint, elect. Cf. _T.A._ i. 1. 125: \"To this your son is\\nmark\\'d, and die he must.\"\\n\\n40. _To see thee married once._ Once see thee married.\\n\\n51. _Much upon these years._ Nearly at the same age. Cf. _M. for M._ iv.\\n1. 17: \"much upon this time;\" _Rich. III._ v. 3. 70: \"Much about\\ncock-shut time,\" etc. As Juliet is fourteen, Lady Capulet would be about\\ntwenty-eight, while her husband, having done masking for some thirty\\nyears (see i. 5. 35 fol.), must be at least sixty. See also on v. 3. 207\\nbelow.\\n\\n55. _A man of wax._ \"As pretty as if he had been modelled in wax\"\\n(Schmidt). Steevens quotes _Wily Beguiled_: \"Why, he\\'s a man as one\\nshould picture him in wax.\" White adds from Lyly, _Euphues and his\\nEngland_: \"so exquisite that for shape he must be framed in wax,\" and\\nrefers to iii. 3. 126 below. Dyce cites _Faire Em_:--\\n\\n  \"A sweet face, an exceeding daintie hand:\\n  A body, were it framed of wax\\n  By all the cunning artists of the world,\\n  It could not better be proportioned.\"\\n\\n60. _Read o\\'er the volume_, etc. Here one quibble leads to another by\\nthe power of association. \"The _volume_ of young Paris\\'s face suggests\\nthe _beauty\\'s pen_, which hath _writ_ there. Then the obscurities of the\\nfair volume are written in _the margin of his eyes_ as comments of\\nancient books are always printed in the margin. Lastly, this _book of\\nlove_ lacks a _cover_; the _golden story_ must be locked with _golden\\nclasps_\" (Knight).\\n\\n62. _Married._ The reading of 2d quarto; the other early eds. have\\n\"severall,\" which some editors adopt. _Married_ = \"closely joined, and\\nhence concordant, harmonious\" (Schmidt). Cf. _T. and C._ i. 3. 100: \"The\\nunity and married calm of states;\" and _Sonn._ 8. 6:--\\n\\n  \"If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\n  By unions married, do offend thine ear.\"\\n\\nSee also Milton, _L\\'All._ 137: \"Married to immortal verse.\"\\n\\n65. _Margent._ Malone quotes _R. of L._ 102:--\\n\\n  \"But she that never cop\\'d with stranger eyes\\n    Could pick no meaning from their parting looks,\\n  Nor read the subtle shining secrecies\\n    Writ in the glassy margent of such books.\"\\n\\nSee also _Ham._ v. 2. 162.\\n\\n67. _Cover._ \"A quibble on the law phrase for a married woman, who is\\nstyled a _femme couverte_ [_feme covert_] in law French\" (Mason).\\n\\n68. _Lives in the sea._ Is not yet caught. The bride has not yet been\\nwon. Farmer thought it an allusion to fish-skin as used for binding\\nbooks.\\n\\n70. _Many\\'s._ Cf. _Sonn._ 93. 7: \"In many\\'s looks,\" etc.\\n\\n74. _Like of._ Cf. _Much Ado_, v. 4. 59: \"I am your husband, if you like\\nof me.\"\\n\\n76. _Endart._ Not elsewhere used by S. and perhaps of his own coining.\\n\\n80. _Cursed._ Because she is not at hand to help. _In extremity_ = at a\\ndesperate pass. Cf. _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 3, _A.Y.L._ iv. 1. 5, etc.\\n\\n83. _County._ Count; as often in this play. See also _M. of V._ i. 2.\\n49, _A.W._ iii. 7. 22, etc.\\n\\n\\nSCENE IV.--Mercutio is thus described in Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"At thone syde of her chayre, her lover Romeo:\\n  And on the other side there sat one cald Mercutio.\\n  A courtier that eche where was highly had in pryce:\\n  For he was coorteous of his speche, and pleasant of devise.\\n  Euen as a Lyon would emong the lambes be bolde:\\n  Such was emong the bashfull maydes, Mercutio to beholde.\\n  With frendly gripe he ceasd [seized] fayre Juliets snowish hand:\\n  A gyft he had that nature gaue him in his swathing band.\\n  That frosen mountayne yse was neuer halfe so cold\\n  As were his handes, though nere so neer the fire he dyd them holde.\"\\n\\nIn Paynter\\'s _Palace of Pleasure_ he is spoken of as \"an other Gentleman\\ncalled _Mercutio_, which was a courtlyke Gentleman, very well beloued of\\nall men, and by reason of his pleasaunt and curteous behauior was in\\neuery company wel intertayned.\" His \"audacity among Maydens\" and his\\ncold hands are also mentioned.\\n\\n1. _This speech._ Furness would read \"the speech\"; but, as the scene\\nopens in the midst of the conversation, S. may have meant to imply that\\nsome one in the company has suggested an introductory speech. See the\\nfollowing note.\\n\\n3. _The date is out_, etc. That is, such tediousness is now out of\\nfashion. Steevens remarks: \"In _Henry VIII._ where the king introduces\\nhimself to the entertainment given by Wolsey [i. 4] he appears, like\\nRomeo and his companions, in a _mask_, and sends a messenger before to\\nmake an apology for his intrusion. This was a custom observed by those\\nwho came uninvited, with a desire to conceal themselves for the sake of\\nintrigue, or to enjoy the greater freedom of conversation. Their entry\\non these occasions was always prefaced by some speech in praise of the\\nbeauty of the ladies or the generosity of the entertainer; and to the\\n_prolixity_ of such introductions I believe Romeo is made to allude. So\\nin _Histrio-mastix_, 1610, a man expresses his wonder that the maskers\\nenter without any compliment: \\'What, come they in so blunt, without\\ndevice?\\' In the accounts of many entertainments given in reigns\\nantecedent to that of Elizabeth, I find this custom preserved. Of the\\nsame kind of masquerading see a specimen in _T. of A._ [i. 2], where\\nCupid precedes a troop of ladies with a speech.\" Collier compares\\n_L. L. L._ v. 2. 158 fol.\\n\\n5. _Bow of lath._ The Tartar bows resembled in form the old Roman or\\nCupid\\'s bow, such as we see on medals and bas-reliefs; while the English\\nbow had the shape of the segment of a circle.\\n\\n6. _Crow-keeper._ Originally a boy stationed in a field to drive the\\nbirds away (as in _Lear_, iv. 6. 88: \"That fellow handles his bow like a\\ncrow-keeper\"); afterwards applied, as here, to what we call a\\n_scarecrow_. The latter was often a stuffed figure with a bow in his\\nhand.\\n\\n7, 8. These lines are found only in the 1st quarto, and were first\\ninserted in the text by Pope. White believes that they were purposely\\nomitted, but only on account of their disparagement of the\\nprologue-speakers on the stage. Prologues and epilogues were often\\nprepared, not by the author of the play, but by some other person; and\\nthis was probably the case with some of the prologues and epilogues in\\nS. _Faintly_ = \"in a weak mechanical way\" (Ulrici). _Entrance_ is a\\ntrisyllable, as in _Macb._ i. 5. 40.\\n\\n10. _A measure._ A formal courtly dance. Cf. _Much Ado_, ii. 1. 80: \"as\\na measure, full of state and ancientry;\" and for the play on the word,\\n_Id._ ii. 1. 74, _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 384, and _Rich. II._ iii. 4. 7.\\n\\n11. _A torch._ Maskers were regularly attended by torch-bearers. The\\ncommentators quote illustrations of this from other authors, but do not\\nrefer to _M. of V._ ii. 4. 5: \"We have not spoke us yet of\\ntorch-bearers;\" and 21 just below:--\\n\\n  \"Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?\\n  I am provided of a torch-bearre.\"\\n\\nSee also _Id._ ii. 6. 40 fol. For the contemptuous use of _ambling_, see\\n_Ham._ iii. 1. 151, _1 Hen. IV._ iii. 2. 60, etc.\\n\\n12. _The light._ For the poet\\'s frequent playing on the different senses\\nof _light_, see on i. 1. 134 above. Cf. ii. 2. 105 below.\\n\\n15. _Soul._ For the play on the word, cf. _M. of V._ ii. 4. 68, iv. 1.\\n123, and, _J.C._ i. 1. 15.\\n\\n19. _Enpierced._ Used by S. nowhere else.\\n\\n20. _Bound._ For the quibble, Steevens compares Milton, _P.L._ iv.\\n180:--\\n\\n                  \"in contempt\\n  At one slight bound high overleap\\'d all bound\\n  Of hill or highest wall,\" etc.\\n\\n29. _Give me a case._ Perhaps Mercutio thinks he will wear a mask, and\\nthen changes his mind. Littledale suggests pointing \"visage in!\" It is\\npossible, however, that lines 30-32 refer to a mask that is handed to\\nhim, and which he decides to wear, though it is an ugly one. On the\\nwhole, I prefer this explanation.\\n\\n31. _Quote._ Note, observe. Cf. _Ham._ ii. 1. 112:--\\n\\n  \"I am sorry that with better heed and judgment\\n  I had not quoted him.\"\\n\\n32. _Beetle-brows._ Prominent or overhanging brows. Cf. the verb\\n_beetle_ in _Ham._ i. 4. 71.\\n\\n36. _Rushes._ Before the introduction of carpets floors were strewn with\\nrushes. Cf. _1 Hen. IV._ iii. 1. 214: \"on the wanton rushes lay you\\ndown;\" _Cymb._ ii. 2. 13:--\\n\\n                  \"Our Tarquin thus\\n  Did softly press the rushes,\" etc.\\nSee also _R. of L._ 318, _T. of S._ iv. 1. 48, and _2 Hen. IV._ v. 5. 1.\\nThe stage was likewise strewn with rushes. Steevens quotes Dekker, _Guls\\nHornbook_: \"on the very rushes where the comedy is to daunce.\"\\n\\n37. _I am proverb\\'d_, etc. The old proverb fits my case, etc. _To hold\\nthe candle_ is a very common phrase for being _an idle spectator_. Among\\nRay\\'s proverbs is \"A good candle-holder proves a good gamester\"\\n(Steevens).\\n\\n39. _The game_, etc. An old proverbial saying advises to give over when\\nthe game is at the fairest; and Romeo also alludes to this.\\n\\n40. _Dun\\'s the mouse._ Apparently = keep still; but no one has\\nsatisfactorily explained the origin of the phrase. Malone quotes\\n_Patient Grissel_, 1603: \"yet don is the mouse, lie still;\" and Steevens\\nadds _The Two Merry Milkmaids_, 1620: \"Why then \\'tis done, and dun\\'s the\\nmouse and undone all the courtiers.\"\\n\\n41. _If thou art Dun_, etc. Douce quotes Chaucer, _C.T._ 16936:\\n\\n  \"Ther gan our hoste for to jape and play,\\n  And sayde, \\'sires, what? Dun is in the myre.\\'\"\\n\\nGifford explains the expression thus: \"_Dun in the mire_ is a Christmas\\ngambol, at which I have often played. A log of wood is brought into the\\nmidst of the room: this is _Dun_ (the cart-horse), and a cry is raised\\nthat he is _stuck in the mire_. Two of the company advance, either with\\nor without ropes, to draw him out. After repeated attempts, they find\\nthemselves unable to do it, and call for more assistance. The game\\ncontinues till all the company take part in it, when Dun is extricated\\nof course; and the merriment arises from the awkward and affected\\nefforts of the rustics to lift the log, and from sundry arch\\ncontrivances to let the ends of it fall on one another\\'s toes. This will\\nnot be thought a very exquisite amusement; and yet I have seen much\\nhonest mirth at it.\" Halliwell-Phillipps quotes _Westward Hoe_, 1607: \"I\\nsee I\\'m born still to draw dun out o\\' th\\' mire for you; that wise beast\\nwill I be;\" and Butler, _Remains_: \"they meant to leave reformation,\\nlike Dun in the mire.\"\\n\\n42. _Sir-reverence._ A contraction of \"save reverence\" (_salva\\nreverentia_), used as an apology for saying what might be deemed\\nimproper. Cf. _C. of E._ iii. 2. 93: \"such a one as a man may not speak\\nof without he say \\'Sir-reverence.\\'\" Taylor the Water-Poet says in one of\\nhis epigrams:--\\n\\n  \"If to a foule discourse thou hast pretence,\\n  Before thy foule words name sir-reverence,\\n  Thy beastly tale most pleasantly will slip,\\n  And gaine thee praise, when thou deserv\\'st a whip.\"\\n\\nHere \"Mercutio says he will draw Romeo from the _mire of this love_, and\\nuses parenthetically the ordinary form of apology for speaking so\\nprofanely of love\" (Knight). For the full phrase, see _Much Ado_, iii.\\n4. 32, _M. of V._ ii. 2. 27, 139, etc.\\n\\n43. _Burn daylight._ \"A proverbial expression used when candles are\\nlighted in the daytime\" (Steevens); hence applied to superfluous actions\\nin general. Here it is = waste time, as the context shows. Cf. _M.W._\\nii. 1. 54, where it has the same meaning.\\n\\n45. _We waste_, etc. The quartos have \"We waste our lights in vaine,\\nlights lights by day;\" the folios, \"We wast our lights in vaine, lights,\\nby day.\" The emendation is Capell\\'s. Daniel and Dowden read, \"light\\nlights by day,\" which is very plausible.\\n\\n47. _Five wits._ Cf. _Much Ado_, i. 1. 66: \"four of his five wits went\\nhalting off;\" _Sonn._ 141. 9: \"But my five wits nor my five senses.\"\\nHere the _five wits_ are distinguished from the _five senses_; but the\\ntwo expressions were sometimes used interchangeably. The _five wits_, on\\nthe other hand, were defined as \"common wit, imagination, fantasy,\\nestimation (judgment), and memory.\"\\n\\n50. _To-night._ That is, last night, as in _M.W._ iii. 3. 171: \"I have\\ndreamed to-night;\" _W.T._ ii. 3. 10: \"He took good rest to-night,\" etc.\\nSee also ii. 4. 2 below.\\n\\n53. _Queen Mab._ No earlier instance of _Mab_ as the name of the\\nfairy-queen has been discovered, but S. no doubt learned it from the\\nfolk-lore of his own time. Its derivation is uncertain.\\n\\n54. _The fairies\\' midwife._ Not midwife _to_ the fairies, but the fairy\\nwhose department it was to deliver the fancies of sleeping men of their\\ndreams, those _children of an idle brain_ (Steevens). T. Warton believes\\nshe was so called because she steals new-born infants, and leaves\\n\"changelings\" (see _M.N.D._ ii. 1. 23, etc.) in their place.\\n\\n55. _No bigger_, etc. That is, no bigger than the figures cut in such an\\nagate. Cf. _Much Ado_, iii. 1. 65: \"If low, an agate very vilely cut.\"\\nRings were sometimes worn on the _thumb_. Steevens quotes Glapthorne,\\n_Wit in a Constable_, 1639: \"and an alderman as I may say to you, he has\\nno more wit than the rest o\\' the bench; and that lies in his\\nthumb-ring.\"\\n\\n57. _Atomies._ Atoms, or creatures as minute as atoms. Cf. _A.Y.L._\\niii. 2. 245: \"to count atomies;\" and _Id._ iii. 5. 13: \"Who shut their\\ncoward gates on atomies.\" In _2 Hen. IV._ v. 4. 33, Mrs. Quickly\\nconfounds the word with _anatomy._ S. uses it only in these four\\npassages, _atom_ not at all.\\n\\n59. _Spinners._ Long-legged spiders, mentioned also in _M.N.D._ ii. 2.\\n21: \"Hence, you long-legg\\'d spinners, hence!\"\\n\\n65. _Worm._ Nares says, under _idle worms_: \"Worms bred in idleness. It\\nwas supposed, and the notion was probably encouraged for the sake of\\npromoting industry, that when maids were idle, worms bred in their\\nfingers;\" and he cites Beaumont and Fletcher, _Woman Hater_, iii. 1:--\\n\\n  \"Keep thy hands in thy muff and warm the idle\\n  Worms in thy fingers\\' ends.\"\\n\\n67-69. _Her chariot ... coachmakers._ Daniel puts these lines before 59.\\nLettsom says: \"It is preposterous to speak of the parts of a chariot\\n(such as the waggon-spokes and cover) before mentioning the chariot\\nitself.\" But _chariot_ here, as the description shows, means only the\\n_body_ of the vehicle, and is therefore one of the \"parts.\"\\n\\n76. _Sweetmeats._ That is, kissing-comfits. These artificial aids to\\nperfume the breath are mentioned by Falstaff, in _M.W._ v. 5. 22.\\n\\n77. _A courtier\\'s nose._ As this is a repetition, Pope substituted\\n\"lawyer\\'s\" (from 1st quarto), but this would also be a repetition. Other\\nsuggestions are \"tailor\\'s\" and \"counsellor\\'s;\" but the carelessness of\\nthe description is in perfect keeping with the character. See the\\ncomments on the speech p. 290 below.\\n\\n79. _Sometime._ Used by S. interchangeably with _sometimes_.\\n\\n84. _Ambuscadoes._ Ambuscades; used by S. only here. The _Spanish\\nblades_ of Toledo were famous for their quality.\\n\\n85. _Healths_, etc. Malone quotes _Westward Hoe_, 1607: \"troth, sir, my\\nmaster and sir Goslin are guzzling; they are dabbling together fathom\\ndeep. The knight has drunk so much health to the gentleman yonder, upon\\nhis knees, that he hath almost lost the use of his legs.\" Cf. _2 Hen.\\nIV._ v. 3. 57:--\\n\\n  \"Fill the cup, and let it come;\\n  I\\'ll pledge you a mile to the bottom.\"\\n\\n89. _Plats the manes_, etc. \"This alludes to a very singular\\nsuperstition not yet forgotten in some parts of the country. It was\\nbelieved that certain malignant spirits, whose delight was to wander in\\ngroves and pleasant places, assumed occasionally the likeness of women\\nclothed in white; that in this character they sometimes haunted stables\\nin the night-time, carrying in their hands tapers of wax, which they\\ndropped on the horses\\' manes, thereby plaiting them in inextricable\\nknots, to the great annoyance of the poor animals and vexation of their\\nmasters. These hags are mentioned in the works of William of Auvergne,\\nbishop of Paris in the 13th century\" (Douce).\\n\\n90. _Elf-locks._ Hair matted or clotted, either from neglect or from the\\ndisease known as the _Plica Polonica_. Cf. _Lear_, ii. 3. 10: \"elf all\\nmy hair in knots;\" and Lodge, _Wit\\'s Miserie_, 1596: \"His haires are\\ncurld and full of elves locks.\"\\n\\n91. _Which_, etc. The real subject of _bodes_ is _which once untangled_\\n= the untangling of which.\\n\\n97. _Who._ For _which_, as often; but here, perhaps, on account of the\\npersonification. Cf. _2 Hen. IV._ iii. 1. 22:--\\n\\n                  \"the winds,\\n  Who take the ruffian billows by the top.\"\\n\\n103. _My mind misgives_, etc. One of many illustrations of Shakespeare\\'s\\nfondness for presentiments. Cf. ii. 2. 116, iii. 5. 53, 57, etc., below.\\nSee also 50 above.\\n\\n105. _Date._ Period, duration; as often in S. Cf. _R. of L._ 935: \"To\\nendless date of never-ending woes;\" _Sonn._ 18. 4: \"And summer\\'s lease\\nhath all too short a date;\" _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 373: \"With league whose\\ndate till death shall never end,\" etc.\\n\\n106. _Expire._ The only instance of the transitive use in S. Cf.\\nSpenser, _F.Q._ iv. 1. 54: \"Till time the tryall of her truth expyred.\"\\n\\n107. _Clos\\'d._ Enclosed, shut up. Cf. v. 2. 30 below: \"clos\\'d in a dead\\nman\\'s tomb.\" See also _R. of L._ 761, _Macb._ iii. 1. 99, etc.\\n\\n111. In the early eds. the stage-direction is \"_They march about the\\nStage, and Seruingmen come forth with_ [or _with their_] _Napkins_.\"\\nThis shows that the scene was supposed to be immediately changed to the\\nhall of Capulet\\'s house.\\n\\n\\nSCENE V.--2. _Shift a trencher._ \"Trenchers [wooden plates] were still\\nused by persons of good fashion in our author\\'s time. In the _Household\\nBook of the Earls of Northumberland_, compiled at the beginning of the\\nsame century, it appears that they were common to the tables of the\\nfirst nobility\" (Percy). To _shift a trencher_ was a technical term. For\\n_scrape a trencher_, cf. _Temp._ ii. 2. 187: \"Nor scrape trencher, nor\\nwash dish.\"\\n\\n7. _Joint-stools._ A kind of folding-chair. Cf. _1 Hen. IV._ ii. 4. 418,\\n_2 Hen. IV._ ii. 4. 269, etc.\\n\\n8. _Court-cupboard._ Sideboard. Steevens quotes Chapman, _Monsieur\\nD\\'Olive_, 1606: \"Here shall stand my court-cupboard with its furniture\\nof plate;\" and his _May-Day_, 1611: \"Court-cupboards planted with\\nflaggons, cans, cups, beakers,\" etc. Cotgrave defines _dressoir_ as \"a\\ncourt-cupboord (without box or drawer), onely to set plate on.\"\\n\\n_Good thou._ For this vocative use of _good_, cf. _Temp._ i. 1. 3, 16,\\n20, _C. of E._ iv. 4. 22, etc.\\n\\n9. _Marchpane._ A kind of almond-cake, much esteemed in the time of S.\\nNares gives the following from one of the old English receipt-books,\\n_Delightes for Ladies_, 1608: \"_To make a marchpane_.--Take two poundes\\nof almonds being blanched, and dryed in a sieve over the fire, beate\\nthem in a stone mortar, and when they be small mix them with two pounde\\nof sugar beeing finely beaten, adding two or three spoonefuls of\\nrosewater, and that will keep your almonds from oiling: when your paste\\nis beaten fine, drive it thin with a rowling pin, and so lay it on a\\nbottom of wafers, then raise up a little edge on the side, and so bake\\nit, then yce it with rosewater and sugar, then put it in the oven\\nagaine, and when you see your yce is risen up and drie, then take it out\\nof the oven and garnish it with pretie conceipts, as birdes and beasts\\nbeing cast out of standing moldes. Sticke long comfits upright in it,\\ncast bisket and carrowaies in it, and so serve it; guild it before you\\nserve it: you may also print of this _marchpane_ paste in your molds for\\nbanqueting dishes. And of this paste our comfit makers at this day make\\ntheir letters, knots, armes, escutcheons, beasts, birds, and other\\nfancies.\" Castles and other figures were often made of marchpane, to\\ndecorate splendid desserts, and were demolished by shooting or throwing\\nsugar-plums at them. Cf. Beaumont and Fletcher, _Faithful Friends_, iii.\\n2:--\\n\\n          \"They barr\\'d their gates,\\n  Which we as easily tore unto the earth\\n  As I this tower of marchpane.\"\\n\\n16. _Cheerly._ Cheerily, briskly. Cf. _Temp._ i. 1. 6, 29, etc.\\n\\n16. _The longer liver take all._ A proverbial expression.\\n\\n18. _Toes._ Pope thought it necessary to change this to \"feet.\" Malone\\nremarks that the word \"undoubtedly did not appear indelicate to the\\naudience of Shakespeare\\'s time, though perhaps it would not be endured\\nat this day.\" We smile at this when we recollect some of the words that\\nwere endured then; but it shows how fashions change in these matters.\\n\\n21. _Deny._ Refuse. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 228: \"If you deny to dance;\" _T.\\nof S._ ii. 1. 180: \"If she deny to wed,\" etc. _Makes dainty_ = affects\\ncoyness. Cf. _K. John_, iii. 4. 138:--\\n\\n  \"And he that stands upon a slippery place\\n  Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.\"\\n\\n22. _Am I come near ye now?_ Do I touch you, or hit you, now? Cf. _1 Hen\\nIV._ i. 2. 14: \"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal.\" Schmidt is clearly\\nwrong in giving _T.N._ ii. 5. 29 as another example of the phrase in\\nthis sense. He might have given _T.N._ iii. 4. 71.\\n\\n23. _Welcome, gentlemen!_ Addressed to the masked friends of Romeo.\\n\\n28. _A hall, a hall!_ This exclamation occurs frequently in the old\\ncomedies, and is = make room. Cf. _Doctor Dodypoll_, 1600: \"Room! room!\\na hall! a hall!\" and Jonson, _Tale of a Tub_: \"Then cry, a hall! a\\nhall!\"\\n\\n29. _Turn the tables up._ The tables in that day were flat leaves hinged\\ntogether and placed on trestles; when removed they were therefore turned\\nup (Steevens).\\n\\n30. _The fire._ S. appears to have forgotten that the time was in\\nsummer. See p. 19 above.\\n\\n32. _Cousin._ The \"uncle Capulet\" of i. 2. 70. The word was often used\\nloosely = kinsman in S. Cf. iii. 1. 143 below: \"Tybalt, my cousin! O my\\nbrother\\'s child!\"\\n\\n37. _Nuptial._ The regular form in S. In the 1st folio _nuptials_ occurs\\nonly in _Per._ v. 3. 80.\\n\\n43. _What lady is that_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"At length he saw a mayd, right fayre of perfect shape:\\n  Which Theseus, or Paris would haue chosen to their rape.\\n  Whom erst he neuer sawe, of all she pleasde him most:\\n  Within himselfe he sayd to her, thou iustly mayst thee boste.\\n  Of perfit shapes renoune, and Beauties sounding prayse:\\n  Whose like ne hath, ne shalbe seene, ne liueth in our dayes.\\n  And whilest he fixd on her his partiall perced eye,\\n  His former loue, for which of late he ready was to dye,\\n  Is nowe as quite forgotte, as it had neuer been.\"\\n\\n47. _Her beauty hangs._ The reading of the later folios, adopted by many\\neditors. The quartos and 1st folio have \"It seemes she hangs.\" As\\nVerplanck remarks, it is quite probable that the correction was the\\npoet\\'s own, obtained from some other MS. altered during the poet\\'s life;\\nit is besides confirmed by the repetition of _beauty_ in 49. Delius, who\\nretains _it seems_, thinks that the boldness of the simile led the poet\\nto introduce it in that way; but it is Romeo who is speaking, and the\\nsimile is not over-bold for him. The commentators often err in looking\\nat the text from the \"stand-point\" of the critic rather than that of the\\ncharacter.\\n\\n48. _Ethiope\\'s ear._ For the simile, cf. _Sonn._ 27. 11: \"Which, like a\\njewel hung in ghastly night,\" etc. Holt White quotes Lyly, _Euphues_: \"A\\nfair pearl in a Morian\\'s ear.\"\\n\\n55. _I ne\\'er saw_, etc. Cf. _Hen. VIII._ i. 4. 75:--\\n\\n  \"The fairest hand I ever touch\\'d! O beauty,\\n  Till now I never knew thee!\"\\n\\n57. _What dares_, etc. How dares, or why dares, etc. Cf. _2 Hen. IV._ i.\\n2. 129: \"What tell you me of it? be it as it is;\" _A. and C._ v. 2. 316:\\n\"What should I stay?\" etc.\\n\\n58. _Antic face._ Referring to Romeo\\'s mask. Cf. ii. 4. 29 below.\\n\\n59. _Fleer._ Sneer, mock; as in _Much Ado_, v. 1. 58, etc. For _scorn\\nat_, cf. _A.Y.L._ iii. 5. 131, _K. John_, i. 1. 228, etc. We find\\n_scorn_ without the preposition in _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 147: \"How will he\\nscorn!\" _Solemnity_ here expresses only the idea of ceremony, or formal\\nobservance. Cf. the use of _solemn_ = ceremonious, formal; as in _Macb._\\niii. 1. 14: \"To-night we hold a solemn supper, sir;\" _T. of S._ iii. 2.\\n103: \"our solemn festival,\" etc. Hunter quotes Harrington, _Ariosto_:--\\n\\n  \"Nor never did young lady brave and bright\\n  Like dancing better on a solemn day.\"\\n\\n64. _In spite._ In malice; or, as Schmidt explains it, \"only to defy and\\nprovoke us.\" Cf. i. 1. 75 above.\\n\\n67. _Content thee._ \"Compose yourself, keep your temper\" (Schmidt). Cf.\\n_Much Ado_, v. 1. 87, _T. of S._ i. 1. 90, 203, ii. 1. 343, etc. So _be\\ncontented_; as in _M.W._ iii. 3. 177, _Lear_, iii, 4. 115, etc.\\n\\n68. _Portly._ The word here seems to mean simply \"well-behaved,\\nwell-bred,\" though elsewhere it has the modern sense; as in _M.W._ i. 3.\\n69: \"my portly belly;\" _1 Hen. IV._ ii. 4. 464: \"A goodly portly man, i\\'\\nfaith, and a corpulent,\" etc.\\n\\n72. _Do him disparagement._ Do him injury. Cf. \"do danger\" (_J.C._ ii.\\n1. 17), \"do our country loss\" (_Hen. V._ iv. 3. 21), \"do him shame\" (_R.\\nof L._ 597, _Sonn._ 36. 10, _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 204), etc. See also iii. 3.\\n118 below.\\n\\n77. _It fits._ Cf. _A.W._ ii. 1. 147: \"where hope is coldest, and\\ndespair most fits,\" etc.\\n\\n81. _God shall mend my soul!_ Cf. _A.Y.L._ iv. 1. 193: \"By my troth, and\\nin good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are\\nnot dangerous,\" etc. See also _1 Hen. IV._ iii. 1. 255.\\n\\n83. _Cock-a-hoop._ \"Of doubtful origin\" (_New. Eng. Dict._), though the\\nmeaning is clear. _Set cock-a-hoop_ = play the bully. S. uses the word\\nonly here.\\n\\n86. _Scathe._ Injure. S. uses the verb nowhere else; but cf. the noun in\\n_K. John_, ii. 1. 75: \"To do offence and scathe in Christendom;\" _Rich.\\nIII._ i. 3. 317: \"To pray for them that have done scathe to us,\" etc.\\n\\n87. _Contrary._ Oppose, cross; the only instance of the verb in S.\\nSteevens quotes Greene, _Tully\\'s Love_: \"to contrary her resolution;\"\\nWarner, _Albion\\'s England_: \"his countermand should have contraried so,\"\\netc. The accent in S. is variable. Cf. the adjective in iii. 2. 64\\nbelow.\\n\\n88. _Well said._ Well done. Cf. _Oth._ ii. 1. 169, v. 1. 98, etc.\\n_Princox_ = a pert or impertinent boy; used by S. only here. Steevens\\nquotes _The Return from Parnassus_, 1606: \"Your proud university\\nprincox.\" Cotgrave renders \"_un jeune estourdeau superbe_\" by \"a young\\nprincox boy.\"\\n\\nColeridge remarks here: \"How admirable is the old man\\'s impetuosity, at\\nonce contrasting, yet harmonized with young Tybalt\\'s quarrelsome\\nviolence! But it would be endless to repeat observations of this sort.\\nEvery leaf is different on an oak-tree; but still we can only say, our\\ntongues defrauding our eyes, This is another oak leaf!\"\\n\\n91. _Patience perforce._ Compulsory submission; a proverbial expression.\\nNares quotes Ray\\'s _Proverbs_: \"Patience perforce is a medicine for a\\nmad dog\" (or \"a mad horse,\" as Howell gives it). Cf. Spenser, _F.Q._ ii.\\n3. 3:--\\n\\n  \"Patience perforce: helplesse what may it boot\\n  To frett for anger, or for griefe to mone?\"\\n\\n94. _Convert._ For the intransitive use, cf. _R. of L._ 592, _Much Ado_,\\ni. 1. 123, _Rich. II._ v. 1. 66, v. 3. 64, etc. Some make it transitive,\\nwith _now seeming sweet_ (= \"what now seems sweet\") as its object; but\\nthis seems too forced a construction.\\n\\n96. _The gentle fine._ The sweet penance for the offence; that is, for\\nthe rude touch of my hand. For _fine_ the early eds. have \"sin\" or\\n\"sinne.\" The emendation is due to Warburton; but some editors retain\\n\"sin.\"\\n\\n105. _Let lips do_, etc. Juliet has said that palm to palm is holy\\npalmers\\' kiss. She afterwards says that palmers have lips that they must\\nuse in prayer. Romeo replies that the prayer of his lips is that they\\nmay do what hands do, that is, that they may kiss.\\n\\n109. As Malone remarks, kissing in a public assembly was not then\\nthought indecorous. Cf. _Hen. VIII._ i. 4. 28.\\n\\nWhite remarks: \"I have never seen a Juliet on the stage who appeared to\\nappreciate the archness of the dialogue with Romeo in this scene. They\\ngo through it solemnly, or at best with staid propriety. They reply\\nliterally to all Romeo\\'s speeches about saints and palmers. But it\\nshould be noticed that though this is the first interview of the lovers,\\nwe do not hear them speak until the close of their dialogue, in which\\nthey have arrived at a pretty thorough understanding of their mutual\\nfeeling. Juliet makes a feint of parrying Romeo\\'s advances, but does it\\narchly, and knows that he is to have the kiss he sues for. He asks,\\n\\'Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\\' The stage Juliet answers\\nwith literal solemnity. But it was not a conventicle at old Capulet\\'s.\\nJuliet was not holding forth. How demure is her real answer: \\'Ay,\\npilgrim, lips that they must use--in prayer!\\' And when Romeo fairly gets\\nher into the corner, towards which she has been contriving to be driven,\\nand he says, \\'Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg\\'d,\\' and does\\nput them to that purgation, how slyly the pretty puss gives him the\\nopportunity to repeat the penance by replying, \\'Then have my lips the\\nsin that they have took!\\'\"\\n\\n114. _What._ Who; as often. Cf. 130 below.\\n\\n119. _Shall have the chinks._ This seems much like modern slang. S. uses\\nit only here; but Tusser (_Husbandry_, 1573) has both _chink_ and\\n_chinks_ in this sense, and the word is found also in Florio, Cotgrave,\\nHolinshed, Stanihurst, and other old writers.\\n\\n120. _My life_, etc. \"He means that, as bereft of Juliet he should die,\\nhis existence is at the mercy of his enemy, Capulet\" (Staunton). Cf.\\nBrooke:--\\n\\n  \"So hath he learnd her name, and knowth she is no geast.\\n  Her father was a Capilet, and master of the feast.\\n  Thus hath his foe in choyse to geue him lyfe or death:\\n  That scarsely can his wofull brest keepe in the liuely breath.\"\\n\\n124. _Foolish._ A mere repetition of the apologetic _trifling_.\\n_Banquet_ sometimes meant a dessert, as here and in _T. of S._ v. 2.\\n9:--\\n\\n  \"My banquet is to close our stomachs up,\\n  After our great good cheer.\"\\n\\nNares quotes Massinger, _Unnatural Combat_:--\\n\\n  \"We\\'ll dine in the great room, but let the music\\n  And banquet be prepared here;\"\\n\\nand Taylor, _Pennilesse Pilgrim_: \"our first and second course being\\nthreescore dishes at one boord, and after that alwayes a banquet.\"\\n_Towards_ = ready, at hand (Steevens). So _toward_; as in _M.N.D._ iii.\\n1. 81: \"What, a play toward!\"\\n\\n125. _Is it e\\'en so?_ The 1st quarto has here the stage-direction:\\n\"_They whisper in his eare_;\" that is, whisper the reason of their\\ndeparture.\\n\\n128. _By my fay._ That is, by my faith. Cf. _Ham._ ii. 2. 271, etc.\\n\\n130. _Come hither, nurse_, etc. Cf. Brooke:--\\n\\n  \"As carefull was the mayde what way were best deuise\\n  To learne his name, that intertaind her in so gentle wise.\\n  Of whome her hart receiued so deepe, so wyde a wound,\\n  An aucient dame she calde to her, and in her eare gan rounde.[5]\\n  This old dame in her youth, had nurst her with her mylke,\\n  With slender nedle taught her sow, and how to spin with silke.\\n  What twayne are those (quoth she) which prease vnto the doore,\\n  Whose pages in theyr hand doe beare, two toorches light before.\\n  And then as eche of them had of his household name,\\n  So she him namde yet once agayne the yong and wyly dame.\\n  And tell me who is he with vysor in his hand\\n  That yender doth in masking weede besyde the window stand.\\n  His name is Romeus (said shee) a Montegewe.\\n  Whose fathers pryde first styrd the strife which both your householdes\\n      rewe.\"\\n\\n136. _If he be married_, etc. \"Uttered to herself while the Nurse makes\\ninquiry\" (Dowden). _Married_ is here a trisyllable.\\n\\n142. _Prodigious._ Portentous. Cf. _M.N.D._ v. 1. 419, _K. John_, iii.\\n1. 46, _Rich. III._ i. 2. 23, etc.\\n\\n[Footnote 5: That is, whisper. Cf. _W.T._ i. 2. 217, _K. John_, ii. 1.\\n566, etc.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\n_Enter Chorus._ This is generally put at the end of act i., but, as it\\nrefers to the future, rather than the past, it may be regarded as a\\nprologue to act ii. There is no division of acts or scenes in the early\\neds.\\n\\n2. _Gapes._ Rushton quotes Swinburn, _Briefe Treatise of Testaments and\\nLast Willes_, 1590: \"such personnes as do gape for greater bequests;\"\\nand again: \"It is an impudent part still to gape and crie upon the\\ntestator.\"\\n\\n3. On the repetition of _for_, cf. _A.W._ i. 2. 29: \"But on us both did\\nhaggish age steal on;\" _Cor._ ii. 1. 18: \"In what enormity is Marcius\\npoor in?\" etc. _Fair_ = fair one; as in _M.N.D._ i. 1. 182, etc.\\n\\n10. _Use._ Are accustomed. We still use the past tense of the verb in\\nthis sense, but not the present. Cf. _Temp._ ii. 1. 175: \"they always\\nuse to laugh at nothing;\" _T.N._ ii. 5. 104: \"with which she uses to\\nseal;\" _A. and C._ ii. 5. 32: \"we use To say the dead are well,\" etc.\\nSee also Milton, _Lycidas_, 67: \"Were it not better done, as others\\nuse,\" etc.\\n\\n14. _Extremities._ That is, extreme difficulties or dangers.\\n\\n\\nSCENE I.--2. _Dull earth._ \"Romeo\\'s epithet for his small world of man,\\nthe earthlier portion of himself\" (Clarke). Cf. _Sonn._ 146. 1: \"Poor\\nsoul, the centre of my sinful earth.\"\\n\\n5. _Orchard._ That is, garden; the only meaning in S.\\n\\n6. _Conjure._ Accented by S. on either syllable, without regard to the\\nmeaning.\\n\\n7. _Humours!_ Fancies, caprices. Some read \"Humour\\'s madman!\\nPassion-lover!\" See on 29 below.\\n\\n10. _Ay me!_ Often changed here and elsewhere to \"Ah me!\" which occurs\\nin the old eds. of S. only in v. 1. 10 below. _Ay me!_ is found thirty\\nor more times. Milton also uses it often.\\n\\n11. _My gossip Venus._ Cf. _M. of V._ iii. 1. 7: \"if my gossip Report be\\nan honest woman of her word.\"\\n\\n13. _Young Abraham Cupid._ The 2d and 3d quartos have \"Abraham: Cupid;\"\\nthe other early eds. \"Abraham Cupid.\" Upton conjectured \"Adam Cupid,\"\\nwith an allusion to the famous archer, Adam Bell, and was followed by\\nSteevens and others. Theobald suggested \"auborn,\" and it has since been\\nshown that _abraham_, _abram_, _aborne_, _aborn_, _abron_, _aubrun_,\\netc., were all forms of the word now written _auburn_. In _Cor._ ii. 3.\\n21 the 1st, 2d, and 3d folios read: \"our heads are some browne, some\\nblacke, some Abram, some bald;\" the 4th folio changes \"Abram\" to\\n\"auburn.\" In _T.G. of V._ iv. 4. 194, the folio has \"Her haire is\\n_Aburne_, mine is perfect _Yellow_.\" These are the only instances of the\\nword in S. \"Auburn\" is adopted by a few editors, and is explained as =\\n\"auburn-haired,\" but that surely is no _nickname_. Schmidt understands\\n\"Young Abraham Cupid\" to be used \"in derision of the eternal boyhood of\\nCupid, though in fact he was at least as old as father Abraham.\" Cf.\\n_L. L. L._ iii. 1. 182: \"This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;\" and\\n_Id._ v. 2. 10: \"For he hath been five thousand years a boy.\" Furness in\\nhis Variorum ed. gives \"Adam,\" but he now prefers \"Abraham\" = the young\\ncounterfeit, with his sham make-up, pretending to be _purblind_ and yet\\n_shooting so trim_. He thinks the allusion to the _beggar-maid_ also\\nfavours this explanation. _Abraham-man_, originally applied to a\\nmendicant lunatic from Bethlehem Hospital, London, came to be a cant\\nterm for an impostor wandering about and asking alms under pretence of\\nlunacy. Herford says that \"Adam\" is made almost certain by _Much Ado_,\\ni. 1. 260; but it is by no means certain that the allusion there is to\\nAdam Bell, as he assumes.\\n\\n_Trim._ The reading of 1st quarto; the other early eds. have \"true.\"\\nThat the former is the right word is evident from the ballad of _King\\nCophetua and the Beggar-Maid_ (see Percy\\'s _Reliques_), in which we\\nread:--\\n\\n  \"The blinded boy that shoots so trim\\n     From heaven down did hie,\\n  He drew a dart and shot at him,\\n     In place where he did lie.\"\\n\\nFor other allusions to the ballad, see _L. L. L._ iv. 1. 66 and _2 Hen._\\n_IV._ v. 3. 106.\\n\\n16. _Ape._ As Malone notes, _ape_, like _fool_ (see on i. 3. 31 above),\\nwas sometimes used as a term of endearment or pity. Cf. _2 Hen. IV._ ii.\\n4. 234: \"Alas, poor ape, how thou sweatest!\"\\n\\n22. _Circle._ Alluding to the ring drawn by magicians. Cf. _A.Y.L._ ii.\\n5. 62: \"a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.\" See also _Hen._\\n_V._ v. 2. 320.\\n\\n25. _Spite._ Vexation. Cf. i. 5. 64 above.\\n\\n29. _Humorous._ Humid. Delius (like Schmidt) sees a quibble in the word:\\n\"_moist_ and _capricious_, full of such humours as characterize lovers,\\nand as whose personification Mercutio had just conjured Romeo under the\\ncollective name _humours_.\"\\n\\n32. _Truckle-bed._ Trundle-bed; one made to run under a \"standing-bed,\"\\nas it was called. Cf. _M.W._ iv. 5. 7: \"his standing-bed and\\ntruckle-bed.\" The former was for the master, the latter for the servant.\\nMercutio uses the term in sport, and adds a quibble on _field-bed_,\\nwhich was a camp-bed, or a bed on the ground.\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.--1. _He jests_, etc. Referring to Mercutio, whom he has\\noverheard, as the rhyme in _found_ and _wound_ indicates. The Cambridge\\ned. suggests that in the old arrangement of the scene the wall may have\\nbeen represented as dividing the stage, so that the audience could see\\nRomeo on one side and Mercutio on the other. Mr. F.A. Marshall thinks\\nthat Romeo \"merely stepped to the back of the stage at the beginning of\\nthe scene, and was supposed to be concealed from the others, not coming\\nout till they had gone. Juliet would appear on the \\'upper stage\\' [the\\nbalcony at the back of the Elizabethan stage], which did duty in the old\\nplays for so many purposes.\"\\n\\n7. _Be not her maid._ Be not a votary to the moon, or Diana (Johnson).\\nCf. _M.N.D._ i. 1. 73.\\n\\n8. _Sick._ The 1st quarto has \"pale,\" which is adopted by some editors.\\nIt has been objected that _sick and green_ is a strange combination of\\n_colours_ in a livery; but it is rather the _effect_ of the colours that\\nis meant. Cf. _T.N._ ii. 4. 116: \"with a green and yellow melancholy.\"\\nPerhaps, as Dowden remarks, the word _green-sickness_ (see iii. 5. 155)\\nsuggested the epithets.\\n\\n29. _White-upturned._ So Theobald and most of the editors. The early\\neds. have \"white, upturned,\" which Marshall prefers as better expressing\\n\"the appearance of an upturned eye by moonlight.\"\\n\\n39. _Thou art thyself_, etc. That is, you would be yourself, or what you\\nnow are, even if you were not a Montague; just \"as a rose is a rose--has\\nall its characteristic sweetness and beauty--though it be not called a\\nrose\" (White). The thought is repeated below in _So Romeo would ... that\\ntitle_. The passage would not call for explanation if critics had not\\nbeen puzzled by it.\\n\\n46. _Owes._ Possesses; as very often. Cf. _M.N.D._ ii. 2. 79, _Macb._ i.\\n3. 76, i. 4. 10, iii. 4. 113, etc.\\n\\n52. _Bescreen\\'d._ Used by S. only here.\\n\\n58. _Yet not._ A common transposition. Cf. _Hen. V._ iii. 3. 46: \"his\\npowers are yet not ready;\" _Hen. VIII._ ii. 4. 204: \"full sick, and yet\\nnot well;\" _Cor._ i. 5. 18: \"My work hath yet not warm\\'d me,\" etc.\\n\\n61. _Dislike._ Displease. Cf. _Oth._ ii. 3. 49: \"I\\'ll do \\'t; but it\\ndislikes me.\" So _like_ = please; as in _Ham._ v. 2. 276: \"This likes me\\nwell,\" etc.\\n\\n62. _Wherefore._ For the accent on the last syllable, cf. _M.N.D._ iii.\\n2. 272: \"Hate me! Wherefore? O me! what news, my love!\"\\n\\n66. _O\\'er-perch._ Used by S. nowhere else.\\n\\n69. _Let._ Hindrance; as in _R. of L._ 330, 646, and _Hen. V._ v. 2. 65.\\nCf. the verb in _Ham._ i. 4. 85, etc.\\n\\n78. _Prorogued._ Delayed; as in iv. 1. 48 below. On _wanting of_, cf. v.\\n1. 40 below: \"Culling of simples.\"\\n\\n83. _As that vast shore_, etc. Possibly suggested, as some have thought,\\nby the voyages of Drake and other explorers to America about the time\\nwhen S. was writing.\\n\\n84. _Adventure._ Venture, try the chance. Cf. _Cymb._ iii. 4. 156:--\\n\\n                  \"O for such means!\\n  Though peril to my modesty, not death on \\'t,\\n  I would adventure.\"\\n\\n89. _Farewell compliment!_ Away with formality! The early eds. have\\n\"complement\" or \"complements,\" as in ii. 4. 19 below and elsewhere.\\n\\n93. _At lovers\\' perjuries_, etc. Douce remarks that S. found this in\\nOvid\\'s _Art of Love_--perhaps in Marlowe\\'s translation:--\\n\\n  \"For Jove himself sits in the azure skies,\\n  And laughs below at lovers\\' perjuries.\"\\n\\nCf. Greene, _Metamorphosis_: \"What! Eriphila, Jove laughs at the\\nperjurie of lovers.\"\\n\\n99. _Haviour._ Not \"\\'haviour,\" as often printed. It is found in North\\'s\\n_Plutarch_ and other prose.\\n\\n101. _To be strange._ To appear coy or shy. Cf. iii. 2. 15 below:\\n\"strange love\" (that is, coy love).\\n\\n103. _Ware._ See on i. 1. 121 above.\\n\\n106. _Discovered._ Revealed, betrayed. Cf. iii. 1. 145 below, where it\\nis = tell, explain.\\n\\n109. _The inconstant moon._ Cf. _M. for M._ iii. 1. 25:--\\n\\n  \"For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,\\n  After the moon.\"\\n\\nSee also _L. L. L._ v. 2. 212, _Lear_, v. 3. 19, and _Oth._ iii. 3. 178.\\nHunter quotes Wilson, _Retorique_, 1553: \"as in speaking of constancy,\\nto shew the sun who ever keepeth one course; in speaking of inconstancy,\\nto shew the moon which keepeth no certain course.\"\\n\\n116. _Do not swear._ Coleridge remarks here: \"With love, pure love,\\nthere is always an anxiety for the safety of the object, a\\ndisinterestedness by which it is distinguished from the counterfeits of\\nits name. Compare this scene with the _Temp._ iii. 1. I do not know a\\nmore wonderful instance of Shakespeare\\'s mastery in playing a distinctly\\nrememberable variation on the same remembered air than in the\\ntransporting love-confessions of Romeo and Juliet and Ferdinand and\\nMiranda. There seems more passion in the one, and more dignity in the\\nother; yet you feel that the sweet girlish lingering and busy movement\\nof Juliet, and the calmer and more maidenly fondness of Miranda, might\\neasily pass into each other.\"\\n\\n117. _Contract._ Accented by S. on either syllable, as suits the\\nmeasure. The verb is always _contrÃ¡ct_. See also on i. 4. 103 above.\\n\\n119. _Like the lightning_, etc. Cf. _M.N.D._ i. 1. 145:--\\n\\n  \"Brief as the lightning in the collied night,\\n  That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\\n  And ere a man hath power to say \\'Behold!\\'\\n  The jaws of darkness do devour it up;\\n  So quick bright things come to confusion.\"\\n\\n124. _As that_, etc. As to that heart, etc.\\n\\n131. _Frank._ Bountiful; repeated in _bounty_. Cf. _Sonn._ 4. 4:--\\n\\n  \"Nature\\'s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\\n  And being frank she lends to those are free;\"\\nand _Lear_, iii. 4. 20: \"Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave\\nall.\"\\n\\n139. _Afeard_. Used by S. interchangeably with _afraid_ (v. 3. 10\\nbelow).\\n\\n141. _Substantial._ Metrically a quadrisyllable.\\n\\n142. _Three words_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"In few vnfained woords your hidden mynd vnfolde,\\n  That as I see your pleasant face, your heart I may beholde.\\n  For if you doe intende my honor to defile:\\n  In error shall you wander still, as you haue done this whyle,\\n  But if your thought be chaste, and haue on vertue ground,\\n  If wedlocke be the ende and marke which your desire hath found:\\n  Obedience set aside, vnto my parentes dewe:\\n  The quarell eke that long agoe betwene our housholdes grewe:\\n  Both me and myne I will all whole to you betake:\\n  And following you where so you goe, my fathers house forsake.\"\\n\\n143. _Bent._ Inclination; as in _J.C._ ii. 1. 210: \"I can give his\\nhumour the true bent,\" etc.\\n\\n144. _Send me word to-morrow_, etc. This seems rather sudden at first\\nglance, but her desire for immediate marriage is due, partially at\\nleast, to what she has just learned (i. 3) of the plan to marry her to\\nParis.\\n\\n151. _Madam!_ This forms no part of the verse, and might well enough be\\nseparated from it, like the _Juliet_ in i. 5. 145 above. _By and by_ =\\npresently; as in iii. 1. 173 and iii. 3. 76 below.\\n\\n152. _Suit._ The reading of 4th (\"sute\") and 5th quartos; the other\\nearly eds. have \"strife.\" The expression \"To cease your sute\" occurs in\\nBrooke\\'s poem, a few lines below the passage just quoted.\\n\\n153. _To-morrow._ \"In the alternative which she places before her lover\\nwith such a charming mixture of conscious delicacy and girlish\\nsimplicity, there is that jealousy of female honour which precept and\\neducation have infused into her mind, without one real doubt of his\\ntruth, or the slightest hesitation in her self-abandonment; for she\\ndoes not even wait to hear his asseverations\" (Mrs. Jameson).\\n\\n157. _Toward school_, etc. Cf. _A.Y.L._ ii. 7. 145:--\\n\\n  \"And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel\\n  And shining morning face, creeping like snail\\n  Unwillingly to school.\"\\n\\n160. _Tassel-gentle._ The _tassel-gentle_ or _tercel-gentle_ is the male\\nhawk. Dyce quotes Cotgrave, _Fr. Dict._: \"Tiercelet. The Tassell or male\\nof any kind of Hawke, so tearmed, because he is, commonly, a third part\\nless than the female;\" and Holmes, _Academy of Armory_: \"_Tiercell_,\\n_Tercell_, or _Tassell_ is the general name for the Male of all large\\nHawks.\" Malone says that the _tiercel-gentle_ was the species of hawk\\nappropriated to the prince, and thinks that on that account Juliet\\napplies it to Romeo. We find _tercel_ in _T. and C._ iii. 2. 56: \"The\\nfalcon as the tercel.\" The hawk was trained to know and obey _the\\nfalconer\\'s voice_. Cf. _T. of S._ iv. 1. 196:--\\n\\n  \"Another way I have to man my haggard,\\n  To make her come and know her keeper\\'s call.\"\\n\\nFor _haggard_ = wild hawk, see _Much Ado_, iii. 1 36, _T.N._ iii. 1. 71,\\netc.\\n\\n163. _Airy tongue._ Cf. Milton, _Comus_, 208: \"And airy tongues, that\\nsyllable men\\'s names,\" etc.\\n\\n166. _Silver-sweet._ Cf. _Per._ v. 1. 111: \"As silver-voic\\'d.\" See also\\niv. 5. 124 below: \"Then music with her silver sound,\" etc. The figure is\\na very common one.\\n\\n167. _Attending._ Attentive. Cf. _T.A._ v. 3. 82: \"To lovesick Dido\\'s\\nsad attending ear.\"\\n\\n171. _I have forgot why I did call thee back._ We know, and she knew,\\nthat it was _only_ to call him back, parting was \"such sweet sorrow.\"\\n\\n178. _A wanton\\'s bird._ Here _wanton_ means simply a playful girl. It is\\noften used in such innocent sense (cf. i. 4. 35 above), and is\\nsometimes masculine, as in _K. John_, v. 1. 70 and _Rich. II._ ii. 3.\\n164.\\n\\n181. _Plucks it back._ Cf. Sonn. 126. 6: \"As thou goest onwards, still\\nwill pluck thee back.\" See also _W.T._ iv. 4. 476, 762 and _A. and C._\\ni. 2. 131. _Pluck_ is a favourite word with S.\\n\\n182. _Loving-jealous._ Compound adjectives are much used by S. Cf. i. 1.\\n79, 176, 178, i. 2. 25, i. 4. 7, 100, etc., above.\\n\\n190. _Dear hap._ Good fortune. The 1st quarto has \"good hap,\" which\\noccurs in iii. 3. 171 below.\\n\\n189. _Ghostly._ Spiritual; as in ii. 3. 45, ii. 6. 21, and iii. 3. 49\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.--1. _Grey-eyed._ Delius says that _grey_ here and in _Much\\nAdo_, v. 3. 27 is = \"bright blue,\" and Dyce defines it as \"blue, azure\";\\nbut there is no reason why the word should not have its ordinary\\nmeaning. The _grey_, as in _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 419, _J.C._ ii. 1. 103, and\\niii. 5. 19 below, is the familiar poetic grey of the early morning\\nbefore sunrise. Whether ascribed, as here, to the eyes of the Morn, or,\\nas in Milton\\'s _Lycidas_, to her sandals, does not matter. See also on\\niii. 5. 8 below.\\n\\n3. _Flecked._ Spotted, dappled; used by S. nowhere else.\\n\\n4. _From forth._ Cf. _M.W._ iv. 4. 53: \"Let them from forth a sawpit\\nrush at once,\" etc. For _Titan_ as the sun-god, cf. _V. and A._ 177, _T.\\nand C._ v. 10. 25, _Cymb._ iii. 4. 166, etc.\\n\\n7. _Osier cage._ Basket. Dowden suggests that _of ours_ is \"possibly not\\nmerely for the rhyme\\'s sake, but because the Franciscan had no personal\\nproperty.\"\\n\\n8. _Precious-juiced flowers._ S. here prepares us for the part which the\\nFriar is afterwards to sustain. Having thus early found him to be a\\nchemist, we are not surprised at his furnishing the sleeping-draught for\\nJuliet. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"What force the stones, the plants, and metals haue to woorke,\\n  And diuers other thinges that in the bowels of earth do loorke,\\n  With care I haue sought out, with payne I did then proue;\\n  With them eke can I helpe my selfe at times of my behoue,\" etc.\\n\\n9. _The earth_, etc. Cf. Milton, _P.L._ ii. 911: \"The womb of nature,\\nand perhaps her grave.\" See also _Per._ ii. 3. 45:--\\n\\n  \"Whereby I see that Time\\'s the king of men,\\n  He\\'s both their parent, and he is their grave.\"\\n\\n15. _Mickle._ Much, great; a word already half obsolete in the time of\\nS. Cf. _C. of E._ iii. 1. 45: \"The one ne\\'er got me credit, the other\\nmickle blame,\" etc. _Powerful grace_ = \"efficacious virtue\" (Johnson);\\nor = gracious power.\\n\\n19. _Strain\\'d._ Wrenched, forced. Cf. _M. of V._ iv. 1. 184: \"The\\nquality of mercy is not strain\\'d\" (that is, excludes the idea of force\\nor compulsion), etc.\\n\\n23. _Weak._ So all the early eds. except 1st quarto, which has \"small.\"\\n_Weak_ seems the better word as opposed to the following _power_\\n(Daniel).\\n\\n25. _With that part._ That is, with its odour. Malone and Clarke take\\n_part_ to be = the sense of smell.\\n\\n26. _Slays._ The 2d quarto has \"staies\" (= stops, paralyzes), which some\\neditors prefer.\\n\\n27. _Encamp them._ For the reflexive use, cf. _Hen. V._ iii. 6. 180:\\n\"we\\'ll encamp ourselves.\" On the figurative _encamp_, cf. _L.C._ 203.\\n\\n29. _Worser._ Cf. iii. 2. 108 below: \"worser than Tybalt\\'s death.\"\\n_Predominant_ was originally an astrological term. See _A.W._ i. 1. 211,\\netc.\\n\\n30. _Canker._ Canker-worm. Cf. _V. and A._ 656: \"The canker that eats up\\nLove\\'s tender spring;\" _T.G. of V._ i. 1. 43: \"in the sweetest bud The\\neating canker dwells,\" etc.\\n\\n34. _Good morrow._ Here = good-by.\\n\\n37. _Unstuff\\'d._ \"Not overcharged\" (Schmidt); used by S. only here.\\n\\n40. _With some._ The editors generally adopt \"by some\" from the 1st\\nquarto; but _with = by_ is so common in S. that the reading of all the\\nother early eds. may be accepted. See on i. 1. 148 and i. 2. 49 above.\\n_Distemperature_ = disorder. Cf. _C. of E._ v. 1. 82: \"Of pale\\ndistemperatures and foes to life.\"\\n\\n41, 42. _Or if not so_, etc. Marshall doubts whether S. wrote these\\nlines. Of course, they belong to the first draft of the play.\\n\\n51. _Both our remedies._ The healing of both of us. Cf. _A.W._ i. 3.\\n169: \"both our mothers\" = the mother of both of us. See also _Ham._ iii.\\n1. 42, _Cymb._ ii. 4. 56, etc.\\n\\n52. _Lies._ Cf. _V. and A._ 1128:--\\n\\n  \"She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,\\n  Where lo! two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.\"\\n\\nSee also _Rich. II_. iii. 3. 168 and _Cymb._ ii. 3. 24.\\n\\n54. _Steads._ Benefits, helps. Cf. _Temp._ i. 2. 165: \"Which since have\\nsteaded much;\" _M. of V._ i. 3. 7: \"May you stead me?\" etc.\\n\\n55. _Homely in thy drift._ Simple in what you have to say. Cf. iv. 1.\\n114 below.\\n\\n56. _Riddling._ Cf. _M.N.D._ ii. 2. 53: \"Lysander riddles very\\nprettily;\" and 1 _Hen. VI._ ii. 3. 57: \"a riddling merchant.\"\\n\\n61. _When and where and how_, etc. An instance of the so-called\\n\"chiastic\" construction of which S. was fond. Cf. _M.N.D._ iii. 1. 113,\\n114, _Ham._ iii. 1. 158, 159, _A. and C._ iii. 2. 15-18, etc.\\n\\n73. _Sighs._ Compared to vapours which the _sun_ dispels.\\n\\n72. _To season love._ A favourite metaphor with S., though a homely one;\\ntaken from the use of salt in preserving meat. For the reference to salt\\ntears, cf. _A.W._ i. 1. 55, _T.N._ i. 1. 30, _R. of L._ 796, _L.C._ 18,\\netc.\\n\\n74. _Ancient._ Aged; as in ii. 4. 133 below. See also _Lear_, ii. 2. 67,\\n_Cymb._ v. 3. 15, etc.\\n\\n88. _Did read by rote_, etc. \"Consisted of phrases learned by heart, but\\nknew nothing of the true characters of love\" (Schmidt).\\n\\n93. _I stand on sudden haste._ I must be in haste. Cf. the impersonal\\nuse of _stand on_ or _upon_ = it concerns, it is important to; as in\\n_C. of E._ iv. 1. 68: \"Consider how it stands upon my credit;\" _Rich._\\n_II._ ii. 3. 138: \"It stands your grace upon to do him right\" (that is,\\nit is your duty), etc. Cf. ii. 4. 34 below.\\n\\n\\nSCENE IV.--2. _To-night._ Last night. See on i. 4. 50 above.\\n\\n13. _How he dares._ For the play on _dare_ = venture, and _dare_ =\\nchallenge, cf. _2 Hen. VI._ iii. 2. 203. There is also a play on\\n_answer_.\\n\\n15. _A white wench\\'s black eye._ Cf. _L. L. L._ iii. 1. 108:--\\n\\n  \"A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,\\n  And two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;\"\\n\\nand Rosalind\\'s reference to the \"bugle eyeballs\" of Phebe in _A. Y.L._\\niii. 5, 47, which the shepherdess recalls as a sneer: \"He said mine eyes\\nwere black,\" etc.\\n\\n_Thorough._ Through. Cf. _M.N.D._ ii. 1. 3, 5, _W.T._ iii. 2. 172,\\n_J.C._ iii. 1. 136, v. 1. 110, etc.\\n\\n16. _The very pin_, etc. The allusion is to archery. The _clout_ (cf.\\n_L. L. L._ iv. 1. 136), or white mark at which the arrows were aimed, was\\nfastened by a black pin in the centre. Cf. Marlowe, _Tamburlane_,\\n1590:--\\n\\n    \"For kings are clouts that every man shoots at,\\n    Our crown the pin that thousands seek to cleave.\"\\n\\n17. _Butt-shaft._ A kind of arrow used for shooting at butts; formed\\nwithout a barb, so as to be easily extracted (Nares).\\n\\n20. _Prince of cats._ _Tybert_ is the name of the cat in _Reynard the\\nFox_. Steevens quotes Dekker, _Satiromastix_, 1602: \"tho\\' you were\\nTybert, the long-tail\\'d prince of cats;\" and _Have with You_, etc.: \"not\\nTibalt, prince of cats.\" _Tibert_, _Tybert_, and _Tybalt_ are forms of\\nthe ancient name _Thibault_. Cf. iii. 1. 77 below.\\n\\n21. _Captain of compliments._ A complete master of etiquette. Cf.\\n_L. L. L._ i. 1. 169:--\\n\\n    \"A man of compliments, whom right and wrong\\n    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.\"\\n\\nAs Schmidt remarks, the modern distinction of _compliment_ and\\n_complement_ is unknown to the orthography of the old eds. See on ii. 2.\\n89 above.\\n\\n22. _Prick-song._ Music sung from notes (Schmidt); so called from the\\npoints or dots with which it is expressed. S. uses the word only here.\\nWhen opposed to _plain-song_, it meant counter-point as distinguished\\nfrom mere melody. Here, as Elson shows, there is a reference to marking\\nthe time \"by tapping the foot in time with the music, or, more\\nfrequently and more artistically, by waving the hand as the conductor of\\nan orchestra waves his baton.\"\\n\\n23. _Me._ For the \"ethical dative,\" cf. _J.C._ i. 2. 270: \"He plucked me\\nope his doublet,\" etc.\\n\\n25. _Button._ Steevens quotes _The Return from Parnassus_, 1606:\\n\"Strikes his poinado at a button\\'s breadth.\" Staunton cites George\\nSilver\\'s _Paradoxes of Defence_, 1599: \"Signior Rocco, ... thou that\\ntakest upon thee to hit anie Englishman with a thrust upon anie button,\"\\netc. Duels were frequent in England in the time of S. The matter had\\nbeen reduced to a science, and its laws laid down in books. The _causes_\\nof quarrel had been duly graded and classified, as Touchstone explains\\nin _A.Y.L._ v. 4. 63 fol.\\n\\n26. _Of the very first house._ Of the first rank among duellists.\\n\\n27. _Passado._ \"A motion forwards and thrust in fencing\" (Schmidt). Cf.\\n_L. L. L._ i. 2. 184: \"the passado he respects not.\" The _punto reverso_\\nwas a back-handed stroke. We have _punto_ (= thrust) in _M.W._ ii. 3.\\n26: \"to see thee pass thy punto.\" The _hay_ was a home-thrust; from the\\nItalian _hai_ = thou hast it (not \"he has it,\" as Schmidt and others\\nexplain it). Johnson gives it correctly: \"The _hay_ is the word _hai_,\\nyou _have_ it, used when a thrust reaches the antagonist, from which our\\nfencers, on the same occasion, without knowing, I suppose, any reason\\nfor it, cry out ha!\"\\n\\n30. _Fantasticoes._ Steevens quotes Dekker, _Old Fortunatus_: \"I have\\ndanced with queens, dallied with ladies, worn strange attires, seen\\nfantasticoes,\" etc.\\n\\n32. _Grandsire._ Addressed to Benvolio in raillery of his staid\\ndemeanour.\\n\\n33. _Fashion-mongers._ Cf. _Much Ado_, v. 1. 94: \"fashion-monging boys.\"\\n\\n34. _Pardonnez-mois._ Fellows who are continually saying\\n_pardonnez-moi_; a hit at Frenchified affectation. The Cambridge ed. has\\n\"perdona-mi\\'s\" (Italian, suggested by the \"pardona-mees\" of the 4th and\\n5th quartos). Herford reads \"pardon-me\\'s.\"\\n\\n35. _Form._ There is a play on the word, as in _L. L. L._ i. 1. 209:\\n\"sitting with her upon the form ... in manner and form following.\"\\nBlakeway remarks: \"I have heard that during the reign of large breeches\\nit was necessary to cut away hollow places in the benches in the House\\nof Commons, to make room for those monstrous protuberances, without\\nwhich contrivance they who stood on the new form could not sit at ease\\non the old bench.\"\\n\\n36. _Bons._ The early eds. have \"bones,\" which is unintelligible. The\\ncorrection is due to Theobald, and is generally adopted.\\n\\n38. _Without his roe._ \"That is, he comes but half himself; he is only a\\nsigh--_O me!_ that is, _me O!_ the half of his name\" (Seymour). It may\\nmean without his mistress, whom he has had to leave; roe meaning a\\nfemale deer as well as the spawn of a fish. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 309,\\nwhere the Princess says: \"Whip to our tents, as roes run over land;\" and\\n_T. and C._ v. 1. 68: \"a herring without a roe.\"\\n\\n42. _Be-rhyme._ Cf. _A.Y.L._ iii. 2. 186: \"I was never so be-rhymed,\"\\netc.\\n\\n43. _Hildings._ Base menials; used of both sexes. Cf. _T. of S._ ii. 1.\\n26: \"For shame, thou hilding;\" _A.W._ iii. 6. 4: \"If your lordship find\\nhim not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect,\" etc. See also iii.\\n5. 167 below. It is used as an adjective in _2 Hen. IV._ i. 1. 57 and\\n_Hen. V._ iv. 2. 29.\\n\\n44. _Grey eye._ Here Malone and others make _grey_ = blue; while\\nSteevens and Ulrici take the ground that it has its ordinary meaning.\\nThe latter quote _Temp._ i. 2. 269 (\"This blue-eyed hag\") in proof that\\nblue eyes were accounted ugly; but the reference there, as in _A.Y.L._\\niii. 2. 393 (\"a blue eye and sunken\"), seems to be to a bluish circle\\nabout the eyes. It is curious that these are the only specific allusions\\nto blue eyes in S. In _W.T._ i. 2. 136, some make \"welkin eye\" = blue\\neye; but it is more probably = heavenly eye, as Schmidt gives it. In _V.\\nand A._ 482 (\"Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth\") the eyelids,\\nnot the eyes, are meant, on account of their \"blue veins\" (_R. of L._\\n440). Cf. _Cymb._ ii. 2. 21:--\\n\\n            \"would under-peep her lids,\\n  To see the enclosed lights, now canopied\\n  Under these windows, white and azure lac\\'d\\n  With blue of heaven\\'s own tinct.\"\\n\\nMalone cites both this last passage and _V. and A._ 482 as referring to\\nblue eyes; but the \"azure _lac\\'d_\" ought to settle the question in\\nregard to the former, and \"windows\" evidently has the same meaning in\\nboth. If the \"blue windows\" _were_ blue eyes, Malone would make out his\\ncase, for in _V. and A._ 140 the goddess says \"Mine eyes are grey and\\nbright.\" But why should the poet call them _blue_ in the one place and\\n_grey_ in the other, when the former word would suit the verse equally\\nwell in both? In my opinion, when he says _blue_ he means blue, and when\\nhe says _grey_ he means grey. See on ii. 3. 1 above. The _New Eng.\\nDict._ does not recognize blue as a meaning of _grey_. It seems,\\nhowever, from certain passages in writers of the time that the word was\\nsometimes = bluish grey or bluish; but never \"bright blue\" (as Delius\\ndefines it) or clear blue, as Dyce and others assume.\\n\\n46. _Slop._ For _slops_ (= large loose breeches), see _Much Ado_, iii.\\n2. 36, etc. _Gave us the counterfeit_ = played a trick on us.\\n_Counterfeit_ is used for the sake of the coming play on _slip_, which\\nsometimes meant a counterfeit coin. Cf. Greene, _Thieves Falling Out_,\\netc.: \"counterfeit pieces of money, being brasse, and covered over with\\nsilver, which the common people call slips.\" There is also a play upon\\nthe word in the only other instance in which S. uses it, _V. and A._\\n515:--\\n\\n  \"Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips\\n  Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.\"\\n\\n58. _Kindly._ The word literally means \"naturally, in a manner suited to\\nthe character or occasion\" (Schmidt); hence aptly, pertinently.\\n\\n63. _Then is my pump_, etc. The idea seems to be, my shoe or _pump_,\\nbeing _pinked_ or punched with holes, is well _flowered_. Cf. _unpinked_\\nin _T. of S._ iv. 1. 136: \"And Gabriel\\'s pumps were all unpink\\'d i\\' the\\nheel.\"\\n\\n68. _Single-soled._ \"With a quibble on _sole_ and _soul_ = having but\\none sole, and silly, contemptible\" (Schmidt). Steevens gives several\\nexamples of _single-soled_ = mean, contemptible. _Singleness_ here =\\nsimplicity, silliness.\\n\\n74. _Wild-goose chase._ A kind of horse-race, resembling the flight of\\nwild geese. Two horses were started together; and if one got the lead\\nthe other was obliged to follow over whatever ground the foremost rider\\nchose to take (Holt White).\\n\\n77. _Was I with you_, etc. Was I even with you, have I paid you off? as,\\nperhaps, in _T. of S._ iv. 1. 170: \"What, do you grumble? I\\'ll be with\\nyou straight!\" For the allusion to _five wits_ see on i. 4. 47 above.\\n\\n80. _I will bite thee by the ear._ A playful expression of endearment,\\ncommon in the old dramatists.\\n\\n81. _Good goose, bite not._ A proverbial phrase, found in Ray\\'s\\n_Proverbs_.\\n\\n82. _Sweeting._ A kind of sweet apple. The word is still used in this\\nsense, at least in New England. Steevens quotes Sumner\\'s _Last Will and\\nTestament_, 1600: \"as well crabs as sweetings for his summer fruits.\"\\nThere was also a variety known as the _bittersweet_. Cf. _Fair Em_: \"And\\nleft me such a bitter sweet to gnaw upon.\"\\n\\n84. _And is it not well served in_, etc. White remarks that \"the passage\\nillustrates the antiquity of that dish so much esteemed by all boys and\\nmany men--goose and apple-sauce.\" Cf. the allusions to mutton and capers\\nin _T.N._ i. 3. 129, and to beef and mustard in _M.N.D._ iii. 1. 197 and\\n_T. of S._ iv. 3. 23.\\n\\n86. _Cheveril._ Soft kid leather for gloves, proverbially elastic. Cf.\\n_Hen. VIII._ ii. 3. 32:--\\n\\n              \"which gifts,\\n  Saving your mincing, the capacity\\n  Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,\\n  If you might please to stretch it.\"\\n\\nSee also _T.N._ iii. 1. 13: \"a cheveril glove,\" etc.\\n\\n90. _A broad goose._ No satisfactory explanation of this quibble has\\nbeen given. Schmidt defines _broad_ here as \"plain, evident.\" Dowden\\nsuggests that there is a play on _brood-goose_, which occurs in\\nFletcher, _Humorous Lieutenant_, ii. 1: \"They have no more burden than a\\nbrood-goose\" (breeding goose).\\n\\n95. _Natural._ Fool, idiot. Cf. _Temp._ iii. 2. 37 and _A.Y.L._ i. 2.\\n52, 57.\\n\\n97. _Gear._ Matter, business. Cf. _T. and C._ i. 1. 6: \"Will this gear\\nne\\'er be mended?\" _2 Hen. VI._ i. 4. 17: \"To this gear the sooner the\\nbetter,\" etc.\\n\\n99. _Two, two_, etc. This is given to Mercutio in most of the early\\neds., and White doubts whether it belongs to the sober Benvolio; but he\\nis not incapable of fun. Cf. 125 below.\\n\\n102. _My fan, Peter._ Cf. _L. L. L._ iv. 1. 147: \"To see him walk before a\\nlady and to bear her fan!\" The fans of the time of S. were large and\\nheavy.\\n\\n105. _God ye good morrow._ That is, God give ye, etc. For _good den_,\\nsee on i. 2. 57 above.\\n\\n109. _Prick of noon._ Point of noon. Cf. 3 _Hen. VI._ i. 4. 34: \"at the\\nnoontide prick.\" See also _R. of L._ 781.\\n\\n123. _Confidence._ Probably meant for _conference_. Cf. _Much Ado_,\\niii. 5. 3, where Dogberry says, \"Marry, sir, I would have some\\nconfidence with you that decerns you nearly.\"\\n\\n125. _Indite._ Probably used in ridicule of the Nurse\\'s _confidence_.\\nMrs. Quickly uses the word in the same way in _2 Hen. IV._ ii. 1. 30:\\n\"he is indited to dinner.\"\\n\\n126. _So ho!_ The cry of the sportsmen when they find a hare. Hence\\nRomeo\\'s question that follows.\\n\\n129. _Hoar._ Often = mouldy, as things grow white from moulding\\n(Steevens).\\n\\n134. _Lady, lady, lady._ From the old ballad of _Susanna_, also quoted\\nin _T.N._ ii. 3. 85: \"There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!\"\\n\\n136. _Merchant._ Used contemptuously, like _chap_, which is a\\ncontraction of _chapman_. Cf. _1 Hen. VI._ ii. 3. 57: \"a riddling\\nmerchant;\" and Churchyard\\'s _Chance_, 1580: \"What saucie merchaunt\\nspeaketh now, saied Venus in her rage?\"\\n\\n137. _Ropery._ Roguery. Steevens quotes _The Three Ladies of London_,\\n1584: \"Thou art very pleasant and full of thy roperye.\" Cf.\\n_rope-tricks_ in _T. of S._ i. 2. 112, which Schmidt explains as \"tricks\\ndeserving the halter.\" Nares and Douce see the same allusion in\\n_ropery_.\\n\\n143. _Jacks._ For the contemptuous use of the word, cf. _M. of V._ iii.\\n4. 77: \"these bragging Jacks;\" _Much Ado_, v. 1. 91: \"Boys, apes,\\nbraggarts, Jacks, milksops!\" etc.\\n\\n144. _Flirt-gills._ That is _flirting Gills_ or women of loose\\nbehaviour. _Gill_ or _Jill_ was a familiar term for a woman, as _Jack_\\nwas for a man. Cf. the proverb, \"Every Jack must have his Jill;\" alluded\\nto in _L. L. L._ v. 2. 885 and _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 461. The word is a\\ncontraction of _Gillian_ (see _C. of E._ iii. 1. 31), which is a\\ncorruption of _Juliana_. _Gill-flirt_ was the more common form.\\n\\n145. _Skains-mates._ A puzzle to the commentators. As _skein_ is an\\nIrish word for knife (used by Warner, Greene, Chapman, and other writers\\nof the time) Malone and Steevens make _skains-mates_ mean \"cut-throat\\ncompanions\" or fencing-school companions. Schmidt defines it as\\n\"messmates,\" and Nares as probably = \"roaring or swaggering companions.\"\\nVarious other explanations have been suggested; but there is probably\\nsome corruption in the first part of the compound.\\n\\n153. _Afore._ Not a mere vulgarism. It is used by Capulet in iii. 4. 34\\nand iv. 2. 31 below. Cf. _Temp._ iv. 1. 7:--\\n\\n        \"here afore Heaven,\\n  I ratify this my rich gift,\" etc.\\n\\n158. _In a fool\\'s paradise._ Malone cities _A handfull of Pleasant\\nDelightes, 1584_:--\\n\\n  \"When they see they may her win,\\n  They leave then where they did begin;\\n  They prate, and make the matter nice,\\n  And leave her in fooles paradise.\"\\n\\nand Barnaby Rich\\'s _Farewell_: \"Knowing the fashion of you men to be\\nsuch, as by praisyng our beautie, you think to bring into a fooles\\nparadize.\"\\n\\n162. _Weak._ Explained by Schmidt as \"stupid.\" Clarke thinks that \"she\\nintends to use a most forcible expression, and blunders upon a most\\nfeeble one.\"\\n\\n177. _And stay_, etc. The pointing is White\\'s. Most editors follow the\\nearly eds. and read \"And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall, etc.\"\\n\\n180. _A tackled stair._ That is, a rope-ladder. Cf. \"ladder-tackle\" in\\n_Per._ iv. 1. 61.\\n\\n181. _High top-gallant._ The top-gallant mast; figuratively for summit\\nor climax. Steevens quotes Markham, _English Arcadia_, 1607: \"the high\\ntop-gallant of his valour.\" S. uses the term only here.\\n\\n183. _Quit._ Requite, reward. Cf. _Ham._ v. 2. 68, 280, etc.\\n\\n184. _Mistress._ A trisyllable here.\\n\\n188. _Two may keep counsel._ That is, keep a secret. Cf. _T.A._ iv. 2.\\n144: \"Two may keep counsel when the third\\'s away.\"\\n\\n191. _Lord_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"A prety babe (quod she) it was when it was yong:\\n  Lord how it could full pretely haue prated with it [its] tong.\"\\n\\n194. _Lieve._ Often used for _lief_ in the old eds. It is sometimes\\nfound in good writers of recent date. MÃ¤tzner quotes Sheridan: \"I had as\\nlieve be shot.\"\\n\\n195. _Properer._ Handsomer. Cf. _A.Y.L._ i. 2. 129, iii. 5. 51, etc. See\\nalso _Hebrews_, xi. 23.\\n\\n197. _Pale as any clout._ A common simile of which Dowden cites examples\\nfrom Bunyan and others. _Versal_ is a vulgarism for _universal_.\\n\\n198. _A letter._ One letter. Cf. _Ham._ v. 2. 276: \"These foils have all\\na length,\" etc. For _rosemary_ as the symbol of remembrance, see _Ham._\\niv. 5. 175.\\n\\n200. _The dog\\'s name._ _R_ was called \"the dog\\'s letter.\" Cf. Jonson,\\n_Eng. Gram._: \"R is the dog\\'s letter and hurreth in the sound.\" Farmer\\ncites Barclay, _Ship of Fools_, 1578:--\\n\\n  \"This man malicious which troubled is with wrath,\\n  Nought els soundeth but the hoorse letter R.\\n  Though all be well, yet he none aunswere hath\\n  Save the dogges letter glowming with nar, nar.\"\\n\\nDyce remarks: \"Even in the days of the Romans, _R_ was called _the dog\\'s\\nletter_, from its resemblance in sound to the snarling of a dog.\"\\n\\n208. _Before, and apace._ Go before, and quickly. For _apace_, cf. iii.\\n2. 1 below.\\n\\n\\nSCENE V.--7. _Love._ That is, Venus. Cf. _Temp._ iv. 1. 94:--\\n\\n                    \"I met her deity\\n  Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\\n  Dove-drawn with her;\"\\n\\nand _V. and A._ 1190:--\\n\\n  \"Thus weary of the world, away she hies,\\n  And yokes her silver doves.\"\\n\\n9. _Highmost._ Cf. _Sonn._ 7. 9: \"But when from highmost pitch, with\\nweary ear,\" etc. We still use _hindmost_, _topmost_, etc.\\n\\n11. _Hours._ A dissyllable; as in iii. 1. 198.\\n\\n14. _Bandy._ A metaphor from tennis. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 29: \"Well\\nbandied both; a set of wit well play\\'d,\" etc. See on iii. 1. 91 below.\\n\\n18. _Honey nurse._ Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 530: \"my fair, sweet, honey\\nmonarch;\" _T. of S._ iv. 3. 52: \"my honey love,\" etc.\\n\\n22. _Them._ S. makes _news_ both singular and plural. For the latter,\\ncf. _Much Ado_, i. 2. 4.\\n\\n25. _Give me leave._ Let me alone, let me rest. See on i. 3. 7 above.\\n\\n26. _Ache._ Spelt \"ake\" in the folio both here and in 49 below. This\\nindicates the pronunciation of the verb. The noun was pronounced\\n_aitch_, and the plural was a dissyllable; as in _Temp._ i. 2. 370, _T.\\nof A._ i. 1. 257, etc.\\n\\n36. _Stay the circumstance._ Wait for the particulars. Cf. _A.Y.L._ iii.\\n2. 221: \"let me stay the growth of his beard,\" etc. On _circumstance_,\\ncf. v. 3. 181 below: \"without circumstance\" (= without further\\nparticulars). See also _V. and A._ 844, _Ham._ v. 2. 2, etc.\\n\\n38. _Simple._ Silly; as often. Cf. iii. 1. 35 below, and _simpleness_ in\\niii. 3. 77.\\n\\n43. _Past compare._ Cf. iii. 5. 236 below: \"above compare,\" etc.\\n\\n50. _As._ As if; a common ellipsis.\\n\\n51. _O\\' t\\'other._ On the other. Cf. i. 1. 44 above: \"of our side.\"\\n\\n52. _Beshrew._ A mild form of imprecation, often used playfully. Cf.\\niii. 5. 221, 227 below.\\n\\n56-58. _Your love_, etc. Printed as prose by the Cambridge editors,\\nDaniel, and some others.\\n\\n66. _Coil._ Ado, \"fuss.\" See _Much Ado_, iii. 3. 100, _M.N.D._ iii. 2.\\n339, etc.\\n\\n72. _Straight at any news._ Capell explains it, \"at such talk (of love\\nand Romeo), _any_ talk of that kind.\" Perhaps, as Dowden suggests, the\\nmeaning is, \"It is their way to redden at any surprise.\"\\n\\n\\nSCENE VI.--9. _These violent delights_, etc. Malone compares _R. of L._\\n894: \"These violent vanities can never last.\" He might have added _Ham._\\nii. 1. 102:--\\n\\n  \"This is the very ecstasy of love,\\n  Whose violent property fordoes itself.\"\\n\\n10. _Like fire and powder._ For the simile, cf. iii. 3. 132 and v. 1. 64\\nbelow.\\n\\n12. _His._ Its; as often. _Its_ was just coming into use when S. wrote.\\nCf. v. 3. 203 below.\\n\\n13. _Confounds._ Destroys; as often. Cf. _Macb._ ii. 2. 12, iv. 1. 54,\\niv. 3. 99, etc. So _confusion_ often = destruction, ruin; as in iv. 5.\\n61 below.\\n\\n15. _Too swift_, etc. \"The more haste, the worse speed.\"\\n\\n17. _Will ne\\'er wear out_, etc. White thinks that the reading of the 1st\\nquarto, \"So light a foot ne\\'er hurts the trodden flower,\" is \"a daintier\\nand more graceful, and therefore, it would seem, a more appropriate\\nfigure.\" The quarto, it is true, gives the \"daintier\" figure, which has\\nbeen used by the poets from Pope\\'s description of Camilla flying \"o\\'er\\nthe unbending corn\" to Tennyson\\'s Olivia in _The Talking Oak_:--\\n\\n  \"The flower she touch\\'d on dipt and rose,\\n    And turn\\'d to look at her.\"\\n\\nIt would be appropriate in the Friar\\'s mouth if he were in the fields,\\nas in ii. 3, and Juliet had met him there. Very likely S. at first wrote\\nit as in the quarto, but his poetic instinct led him to change it in\\nrevising the play. The speaker is now in his cell, with its stone floor\\nworn by the tread of many heavy feet--such as one sees in old churches\\nand monasteries in Europe--but Juliet\\'s light step will not thus wear\\n\"the everlasting flint.\" The comparison is natural and apt.\\n\\n18. _Gossamer._ Light filaments floating in the air, especially in\\nautumn. Their origin was formerly not understood, but they are now\\nknown to be the webs of certain species of spiders. Cf. _Lear_, iv. 6.\\n49: \"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air.\" S. uses the\\nword only twice.\\n\\n20. _Vanity._ \"Here used for \\'trivial pursuit,\\' \\'vain delight.\\' The word\\nwas much used in this sense by divines in Shakespeare\\'s time, and with\\nmuch propriety is so put into the good old Friar\\'s mouth\" (Clarke).\\n\\n21. _Confessor._ For the accent on the first syllable, cf. _M. for M._\\niv. 3. 133: \"One of our covent and his confessor;\" and _Hen. VIII._ i.\\n2. 149: \"His confessor, who fed him every minute,\" etc. See also iii. 3.\\n49 below.\\n\\n25. _And that._ And if. This use of _that_ (in place of a preceding\\nconjunction) is common in S. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 813, _T. and C._ ii. 2.\\n179, etc.\\n\\n26. _Blazon it._ Set it forth. Cf. _Oth._ ii. 1. 63: \"One that excels\\nthe quirks of blazoning pens,\" etc.\\n\\n29. _Encounter._ Meeting. It is often used, as here, of the meeting of\\nlovers. Cf. _Much Ado_, iii. 3. 161, iv. 1. 94, M.W. iii. 5. 74, etc.\\n\\n30. _Conceit._ Conception, imagination. Cf. _Ham._ iii. 4. 114: \"Conceit\\nin weakest bodies strongest works,\" etc. So _conceited_ = imaginative in\\n_R. of L._ 1371: \"the conceited painter,\" etc.\\n\\n32. _They are but beggars_, etc. Cf. _A. and C._ i. 1. 15: \"There\\'s\\nbeggary in the love that can be reckon\\'d.\" _Worth_ = wealth.\\n\\n36. _Leaves._ The plural is used because the reference is to more than\\none person; a common construction in S. Cf. _Rich. II._ iv. 1. 314:\\n\"your sights,\" etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\n\\nSCENE I.--2. _The day is hot._ \"It is observed that in Italy almost all\\nassassinations are committed during the heat of summer\" (Johnson).\\n\\n3. _Scape._ Not \"\\'scape,\" as often printed. The word is used in prose;\\nas in _M. of V._ ii. 2. 174, etc.\\n\\n6. _Me._ See on ii. 4. 23 above. We have the same construction in _him_,\\ntwo lines below, where some eds. have \"it\" (from 1st quarto).\\n\\n8. _Operation._ Effect. Cf. _2 Hen. IV._ iv. 3. 104: \"A good\\nsherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it,\" etc.\\n\\n11. _Am I_, etc. \"The quietness of this retort, with the slight but\\nsignificant emphasis which we imagine thrown upon the _I_, admirably\\ngives point to the humorous effect of Mercutio\\'s lecturing Benvolio--the\\nsedate and peace-making Benvolio, and lectured by Mercutio, of all\\npeople!--for the sin of quarrelsomeness\" (Clarke).\\n\\n12. _Jack._ See on ii. 4. 127 above.\\n\\n14. _Moody._ Angry. Cf. _2 Hen. IV._ iv. 4. 39: \"But, being moody, give\\nhim line and scope,\" etc.\\n\\n31. _Tutor me from._ Teach me to avoid.\\n\\n39. _Good den._ See on i. 2. 57 above.\\n\\n43. _Apt enough to._ Ready enough for. Cf. iii. 3. 157 below.\\n\\n47. _Consort\\'st with._ Keepest company with. Cf. _V. and A._ 1041,\\n_M.N.D._ iii. 2. 387, _T. and C._ v. 3. 9, etc.\\n\\n48. _Consort._ The word (with accent on first syllable) sometimes meant\\na company of musicians. Cf. _T.G. of V._ iii. 2. 84:--\\n\\n  \"Visit by night your lady\\'s chamber-window\\n  With some sweet consort; to their instruments\\n  Tune a deploring dump,\" etc.\\n\\nSee also _2 Hen. VI._ iii. 2. 327. In these passages the modern eds.\\ngenerally read \"concert.\" Milton has _consort_ in the same sense in the\\n_Ode at a Solemn Musick_, 27:--\\n\\n  \"O, may we soon again renew that song,\\n  And keep in tune with Heaven, till God ere long\\n  To his celestial consort us unite,\\n  To live with him, and sing in endless morn of light!\"\\n\\nCf. _Ode on Nativ._ 132: \"Make up full consort to the angelic symphony;\"\\n_Il Pens._ 145: \"With such consort as they keep,\" etc. \"The _consorts_\\nof S.\\'s time were not only concerted music, but generally composed of\\nsuch instruments as belonged to one family. If, for example, only viols\\nwere employed, the consort was called _whole_, but if virginal, lute, or\\nflute came into the combination, it was a _broken consort_, or _broken\\nmusic_\" (Elson). Cf. _A.Y.L._ i. 2. 150, etc.\\n\\n51. _Zounds._ Like _\\'swounds_ (see _Ham._ ii. 2. 604), an oath\\ncontracted from \"God\\'s wounds!\" and generally omitted or changed in the\\nfolio in deference to the statute of James I. against the use of the\\nname of God on the stage. Here the folio has \"Come.\"\\n\\n54. _Reason coldly._ Talk coolly or dispassionately. Cf. _M. of V._ ii.\\n8. 27: \"I reason\\'d with a Frenchman yesterday;\" and _Much Ado_, iii. 2.\\n132: \"bear it coldly but till midnight,\" etc.\\n\\n\"Benvolio presents a triple alternative: either to withdraw to a private\\nplace, or to discuss the matter quietly where they were, or else to part\\ncompany; and it is supremely in character that on such an occasion he\\nshould perceive and suggest all these methods of avoiding public\\nscandal\" (White).\\n\\n55. _Depart._ Perhaps = part. Cf. 3 _Hen. VI._ ii. 6. 43: \"A deadly\\ngroan, like life and death\\'s departing,\" etc. So _depart with_ = part\\nwith; as in _K. John_, ii. 1. 563:--\\n\\n  \"John, to stop Arthur\\'s title in the whole,\\n  Hath willingly departed with a part,\" etc.\\n\\nIn the Marriage Ceremony \"till death us do part\" was originally \"us\\ndepart.\" The word is used in the same sense in Wiclif\\'s Bible,\\n_Matthew_, xix. 6. On the other hand, _part_ often = depart; as in\\n_T.N._ v. 1. 394, _Cor._ v. 6. 73, _T. of A._ iv. 2. 21, etc.\\n\\n57. _I._ The repetition of the pronoun at the end of the sentence is\\ncommon in S. Cf. _T.G. of V._ v. 4. 132: \"I care not for her, I;\" _Rich._\\n_III._ iii. 2. 78: \"I do not like these several councils, I;\" _T.A._ v.\\n3. 113: \"I am no vaunter, I;\" _Id._ v. 3. 185: \"I am no baby, I,\" etc.\\nSee also iii. 5. 12 below.\\n\\n62. _The hate I bear thee._ The reading of 1st quarto. The other early\\neds. have \"love\"; but Tybalt is not given to irony.\\n\\n64. _Love._ Delius says that this \"is of course ironical,\" but the\\nreiteration in the next speech shows that it is not. Romeo\\'s love for\\nJuliet embraces, in a way, all her kindred. His heart, as Talfourd\\nexpresses it in _Ion_,--\\n\\n  \"Enlarge\\'d by its new sympathy with one,\\n  Grew bountiful to all.\"\\n\\n65. _Appertaining rage_, etc. That is, the rage appertaining to\\n(belonging to, or becoming) such a greeting. Cf. _Macb._ iii. 6. 48:--\\n\\n          \"our suffering country\\n  Under a hand accurst.\"\\n\\n68. _Boy._ Often used contemptuously; as in _Much Ado._ v. 1. 83, 187,\\n_Cor._ v. 6. 101, 104, 117, etc.\\n\\n73. _Tender._ Regard, cherish. Cf. _Ham._ i. 3. 107: \"Tender yourself\\nmore dearly,\" etc.\\n\\n76. _A la stoccata._ Capell\\'s emendation of the \"Alla stucatho\" or\\n\"Allastucatho\" of the early eds. _Stoccata_ is the Italian term for a\\nthrust or stab with a rapier. It is the same as the \"stoccado\" of _M.W._\\nii. 1. 234, the \"stock\" of _Id._ ii. 3. 26, and the \"stuck\" of _T.N._\\niii. 4. 303 and _Ham._ iv. 7. 162. _Carries it away_ = carries the day.\\n\\n79. _King of cats._ See on ii. 4. 20 above. On _nine lives_, cf.\\nMarston, _Dutch Courtezan_: \"Why then thou hast nine lives like a cat,\"\\netc. A little black-letter book, _Beware the Cat_, 1584, says that it\\nwas permitted to a witch \"to take on her a cattes body nine times.\"\\nTrusler, in his _Hogarth Moralized_, remarks: \"The conceit of a cat\\'s\\nhaving nine lives hath cost at least nine lives in ten of the whole race\\nof them. Scarce a boy in the streets but has in this point outdone even\\nHercules himself, who was renowned for killing a monster that had but\\nthree lives.\"\\n\\n81. _Dry-beat._ Beat soundly. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 263: \"all dry-beaten\\nwith pure scoff.\" See also iv. 5. 120 below. S. uses the word only three\\ntimes; but we have \"dry basting\" in _C. of E._ ii. 2. 64.\\n\\n83. _Pilcher._ Scabbard; but no other example of the word in this sense\\nhas been found. _Pilch_ or _pilche_ meant a leathern coat, and the word\\nor a derivative of it may have been applied to the leathern sheath of a\\nrapier.\\n\\n87. _Passado._ See on ii. 4. 27 above.\\n\\n89. _Outrage._ A trisyllable here. Cf. _entrance_ in i. 4. 8.\\n\\n91. _Bandying._ Contending. Cf. 1 _Hen. VI._ iv. 1. 190: \"This factious\\nbandying of their favourites.\" For the literal sense, see on ii. 5. 14\\nabove.\\n\\n92. The 1st quarto has here the stage-direction, _\"Tibalt under Romeos\\narme thrusts Mercutio in and flyes_;\" which some modern eds. retain\\nsubstantially.\\n\\n93. _Sped._ Dispatched, \"done for.\" Cf. _M. of V._ ii. 9. 72: \"So\\nbegone; you are sped;\" _T. of S._ v. 2. 185: \"We three are married, but\\nyou two are sped,\" etc. See also Milton, _Lycidas_, 122: \"What need\\nthey? They are sped\" (that is, provided for).\\n\\n100. _Grave._ Farmer cites Lydgate\\'s _Elegy on Chaucer_: \"My master\\nChaucer now is grave;\" and Steevens remarks that we have the same\\nquibble in _The Revenger\\'s Tragedy_, 1608, where Vindice dresses up a\\nlady\\'s skull and says: \"she has a somewhat grave look with her.\" Cf.\\nJohn of Gaunt\\'s play on his name when on his death-bed (_Rich. II._ ii.\\n1. 82).\\n\\n104. _Fights by the book of arithmetic_. Cf. ii. 4. 22 above: \"keeps\\ntime, distance,\" etc.\\n\\n111. _Your houses!_ \"The broken exclamation of a dying man, who has not\\nbreath to repeat his former anathema, \\'A plague o\\' both your houses!\\'\"\\n(Marshall).\\n\\n113. _My very friend._ Cf. _T.G. of V._ iii. 2. 41: \"his very friend;\"\\n_M. of V._ iii. 2. 226: \"my very friends and countrymen,\" etc.\\n\\n116. _Cousin._ Some editors adopt the \"kinsman\" of 1st quarto; but\\n_cousin_ was often = kinsman. See on i. 5. 32 above.\\n\\n120. _Aspir\\'d._ Not elsewhere used transitively by S. Cf. Chapman,\\n_Iliad_, ix.: \"and aspir\\'d the gods\\' eternal seats;\" Marlowe,\\n_Tamburlaine_: \"our souls aspire celestial thrones,\" etc.\\n\\n121. _Untimely._ Often used adverbially (like many adjectives in -_ly_);\\nas in _Macb._ v. 8. 16, _Ham._ iv. 1. 40, etc. See also v. 3. 258 below.\\n\\n122. _Depend._ Impend (Schmidt). Cf. _R. of L._ 1615: \"In me moe woes\\nthan words are now depending;\" and _Cymb._ iv. 3. 23: \"our jealousy Doth\\nyet depend.\"\\n\\n126. _Respective._ Considerate. Cf. _M. of V._ v. 1. 156: \"You should\\nhave been respective,\" etc.\\n\\n127. _Conduct._ Conductor, guide. Cf. _Temp._ v. 1. 244:--\\n\\n  \"And there is in this business more than nature\\n  Was ever conduct of;\"\\n\\n_Rich. III._ i. 1. 45: \"This conduct to convey me to the Tower,\" etc.\\nSee also v. 3. 116 below.\\n\\n129. _For Mercutio\\'s soul_, etc. The passage calls to mind one similar\\nyet very different in _Hen. V._ iv. 6. 15 fol.:--\\n\\n  \"And cries aloud, \\'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!\\n  My soul shall keep thine company to heaven;\\n  Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,\\n  As in this glorious and well-foughten field\\n  We kept together in our chivalry!\\'\"\\n\\n133. _Consort._ Accompany. Cf. _C. of E._ i. 2. 28: \"And afterward\\nconsort you till bedtime;\" _J.C._ v. 1. 83: \"Who to Philippi here\\nconsorted us,\" etc. For the intransitive use of the word, see on 43\\nabove.\\n\\n137. _Doom thee death._ Cf. _Rich. III._ ii. 1. 102: \"to doom my\\nbrother\\'s death;\" _T.A._ iv. 2. 114: \"The emperor, in his rage, will\\ndoom her death.\" _Amazed_ = bewildered, stupefied; as often.\\n\\n139. _Fortune\\'s fool._ Made a fool of by fortune, the sport of fortune.\\nCf. _Lear_, iv. 6. 195: \"The natural fool of fortune.\" See also _Ham._\\ni. 4. 54: \"we fools of nature;\" and cf. _M. for M._ iii. 1. 11, _Macb._\\nii. 1. 44, etc.\\n\\n145. _Discover._ Uncover, reveal. See on ii. 2. 106 above.\\n\\n146. _Manage._ \"Bringing about\" (Schmidt); or we may say that _all the\\nmanage_ is simply = the whole course. The word means management,\\nadministration, in _Temp._ i. 2. 70: \"the manage of my state;\" _M. of\\nV._ iii. 4. 25: \"The husbandry and manage of my house,\" etc. It is\\nespecially used of horses; as in _A.Y.L._ i. 1. 13, etc.\\n\\n156. _Spoke him fair._ Spoke gently to him. Cf. _M.N.D._ ii. 1. 199: \"Do\\nI entice you? do I speak you fair?\" _M. of V._ iv. 1. 275: \"Say how I\\nlov\\'d you, speak me fair in death\" (that is, speak well of me after I am\\ndead), etc.\\n\\n157. _Nice._ Petty, trivial. Cf. _Rich. III._ iii. 7. 175: \"nice and\\ntrivial;\" _J.C._ iv. 3. 8: \"every nice offence,\" etc. See also v. 2. 18\\nbelow.\\n\\n160. _Take truce._ Make peace. Cf. _V. and A._ 82: \"Till he take truce\\nwith her contending tears;\" _K. John_, iii. 1. 17: \"With my vex\\'d\\nspirits I cannot take a truce,\" etc. _Spleen_ = heat, impetuosity. Cf.\\n_K. John_, iv. 3. 97: \"thy hasty spleen;\" _Rich. III._ v. 3. 350:\\n\"Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!\" etc.\\n\\n167. _Retorts._ Throws back; as in _T. and C._ iii. 3. 101:--\\n\\n  \"Heat them, and they retort that heat again\\n  To the first giver,\" etc.\\n\\n171. _Envious._ Malicious; as often.\\n\\n173. _By and by._ Presently. See on ii. 2. 151 above, and cf. iii. 3. 76\\nand v. 3. 284 below.\\n\\n180. _Affection makes him false._ \"The charge, though produced at\\nhazard, is very just. The author, who seems to intend the character of\\nBenvolio as good, meant, perhaps, to show how the best minds, in a state\\nof faction and discord, are detorted to criminal partiality\" (Johnson).\\n\\n188. _Concludes._ For the transitive use (= end), cf. _2 Hen. VI._ iii.\\n1. 153: \"Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.\"\\n\\n190. _Exile._ Accented by S. on either syllable. So also with the noun\\nin iii. 3. 20 and v. 3. 211 below.\\n\\n193. _Amerce._ Used by S. only here.\\n\\n196. _Purchase out._ Cf. buy out in _C. of E._ i. 2. 5, _K. John_, iii.\\n1. 164, _Ham._ iii. 3. 60, etc.\\n\\n198. _Hour._ Metrically a dissyllable; as in ii. 5. 11 above. Cf.\\n_Temp._ v. 1. 4. etc.\\n\\n200. _Mercy but murthers_, etc. Malone quotes Hale, _Memorials_: \"When I\\nfind myself swayed to mercy, let me remember likewise that there is a\\nmercy due to the country.\"\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.--1. _Gallop apace_, etc. Malone remarks that S. probably\\nremembered Marlowe\\'s _Edward II._, which was performed before 1593:--\\n\\n  \"Gallop apace, bright PhÅ“bus, through the skie,\\n  And dusky night, in rusty iron car;\\n  Between you both, shorten the time, I pray,\\n  That I may see that most desired day;\"\\n\\nand Barnaby Rich\\'s _Farewell_, 1583: \"The day to his seeming passed away\\nso slowely that he had thought the stately steedes had bin tired that\\ndrawe the chariot of the Sunne, and wished that Phaeton had beene there\\nwith a whippe.\" For the thought, cf. _Temp._ iv. 1. 30.\\n\\n3. _Phaethon._ For other allusions to the ambitious youth, see _T.G. of\\nV._ iii. 1. 153, _Rich. II._ iii. 3. 178, and _3 Hen. VI._ i. 4. 33, ii.\\n6. 12.\\n\\n6. _That runaways\\' eyes may wink._ This is the great _crux_ of the play,\\nand more has been written about it than would fill a volume like this.\\nThe condensed summary of the comments upon it fills twenty-eight octavo\\npages of fine print in Furness, to which I must refer the curious\\nreader. The early eds. have \"runnawayes,\" \"run-awayes,\" \"run-awaies,\" or\\n\"run-aways.\" Those who retain this as a possessive singular refer it\\nvariously to PhÅ“bus, Phaethon, Cupid, Night, the sun, the moon,\\nRomeo, and Juliet; those who make it a possessive plural generally\\nunderstand it to mean persons running about the streets at night. No one\\nof the former list of interpretations is at all satisfactory.\\nPersonally, I am quite well satisfied to read _runaways\\'_, and to accept\\nthe explanation given by Hunter and adopted by Delius, Schmidt, Daniel,\\nand others. It is the simplest possible solution, and is favoured by the\\n_untalk\\'d of_ that follows. White objects to it that \"_runaway_ seems to\\nhave been used only to mean one who ran away, and that _runagate_, which\\nhad the same meaning then that it has now, would have suited the verse\\nquite as well as _runaway_;\" but, as Furnivall and others have noted,\\nCotgrave apparently uses _runaway_ and _runagate_ as nearly equivalent\\nterms. In a letter in the _Academy_ for Nov. 30, 1878, Furnivall, after\\nreferring to his former citations in favour of _runaways_ = \"runagates,\\nrunabouts,\" and to the fact that Ingleby and Schmidt have since given\\nthe same interpretation, adds, \"But I still desire to cite an instance\\nin which Shakspere himself renders Holinshed\\'s \\'runagates\\' by his own\\n\\'runaways.\\' In the second edition of Holinshed\\'s _Chronicle_, 1587,\\nwhich Shakspere used for his _Richard III._, he found the passage (p.\\n756, col. 2): \\'You see further, how a company of traitors, thieves,\\noutlaws, and _runagates_, be aiders and partakers of this feate and\\nenterprise,\\' etc. And he turned it thus into verse (1st folio, p.\\n203):--\\n\\n  \"\\'Remember whom you are to cope withall,\\n  A sort of Vagabonds, Rascals, and _Run-awayes_,\\n  A scum of Brittaines, and base Lackey Pezants,\\n  Whom their o\\'re-cloyed Country vomits forth\\n  To desperate Aduentures, and assur\\'d Destruction.\\n  You sleeping safe, they bring you to vnrest.\\'\" etc.\\n\\nHerford regards this interpretation as \"a prosaic idea;\" but it seems to\\nme perfectly in keeping with the character and the situation. The\\nmarriage was a secret one, and Juliet would not have Romeo, if seen,\\nsupposed to be a paramour visiting her by night. She knows also the\\ndanger he incurs if detected by her kinsmen. Cf. ii. 2. 64 fol. above.\\n\\n10. _Civil._ Grave, sober. Cf. _M.W._ ii. 2. 101: \"a civil modest wife,\"\\netc.\\n\\n12. _Learn._ Teach; as often. Cf. _A.Y.L._ i. 2. 5, _Cymb._ i. 5. 12,\\netc.\\n\\n14. _Hood my unmann\\'d blood_, etc. The terms are taken from falconry.\\nThe hawk was _hooded_ till ready to let fly at the game. Cf. _Hen. V._\\niii. 7. 121: \"\\'tis a hooded valour; and when it appears it will bate.\"\\nAn _unmanned_ hawk was one not sufficiently trained to know the voice of\\nher keeper (see on ii. 2. 159 above). To _bate_ was to flutter or flap\\nthe wings, as the hawk did when unhooded and eager to fly. Cf. _T. of\\nS._ iv. 1. 199:--\\n\\n                \"as we watch these kites\\n  That bate and beat and will not be obedient.\"\\n\\nDyce quotes Holmes, _Acad. of Armory_: \"_Bate_, Bateing or Bateth, is\\nwhen the Hawk fluttereth with her Wings either from Pearch or Fist, as\\nit were striveing to get away; also it is taken from her striving with\\nher Prey, and not forsaking it till it be overcome.\"\\n\\n15. _Strange._ Reserved, retiring.\\n\\n17. _Come, Night_, etc. Mrs. Jameson remarks: \"The fond adjuration,\\n\\'Come, Night, come, Romeo, _come thou day in night_!\\' expresses that\\nfulness of enthusiastic admiration for her lover which possesses her\\nwhole soul; but expresses it as only Juliet could or would have\\nexpressed it--in a bold and beautiful metaphor. Let it be remembered\\nthat, in this speech, Juliet is not supposed to be addressing an\\naudience, nor even a confidante; and I confess I have been shocked at\\nthe utter want of taste and refinement in those who, with coarse\\nderision, or in a spirit of prudery, yet more gross and perverse, have\\ndared to comment on this beautiful \\'Hymn to the Night,\\' breathed out by\\nJuliet in the silence and solitude of her chamber. She is thinking\\naloud; it is the young heart \\'triumphing to itself in words.\\' In the\\nmidst of all the vehemence with which she calls upon the night to bring\\nRomeo to her arms, there is something so almost infantine in her perfect\\nsimplicity, so playful and fantastic in the imagery and language, that\\nthe charm of sentiment and innocence is thrown over the whole; and her\\nimpatience, to use her own expression, is truly that of \\'a child before\\na festival, that hath new robes and may not wear them.\\' It is at the\\nvery moment too that her whole heart and fancy are abandoned to blissful\\nanticipation that the Nurse enters with the news of Romeo\\'s banishment;\\nand the immediate transition from rapture to despair has a most powerful\\neffect.\"\\n\\n18. _For thou_, etc. \"Indeed, the whole of this speech is imagination\\nstrained to the highest; and observe the blessed effect on the purity of\\nthe mind. What would Dryden have made of it?\" (Coleridge).\\n\\n20. _Black-brow\\'d Night._ Cf. _King John_, v. 6. 17: \"Why, here walk I\\nin the black brow of night.\"\\n\\n25. _The garish sun._ Johnson remarks: \"Milton had this speech in his\\nthoughts when he wrote in _Il Pens._, \\'Till civil-suited morn appear,\\'\\nand \\'Hide me from day\\'s garish eye.\\'\" S. uses _garish_ only here and in\\n_Rich. III._ iv. 4. 89: \"a garish flag.\"\\n\\n26, 27. _I have bought_, etc. There is a strange confusion of metaphors\\nhere. Juliet is first the buyer and then the thing bought. She seems to\\nhave in mind that what she says of herself is equally true of Romeo. In\\nthe next sentence she reverts to her own position.\\n\\n30. _That hath new robes_, etc. Cf. _Much Ado_, iii. 2. 5: \"Nay, that\\nwould be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a\\nchild his new coat and forbid him to wear it.\" See also _Macb._ i. 7.\\n34.\\n\\n40. _Envious._ Malignant; as in i. 1. 148 and iii. 1. 171 above.\\n\\n45. _But ay._ In the time of S. _ay_ was commonly written and printed\\n_I_, which explains the play upon the word here. Most editors print \"but\\n\\'I\\'\" here, but it does not seem necessary to the understanding of the\\nquibble. Lines 45-51 evidently belong to the first draft of the play.\\n\\n47. _Death-darting eye_, etc. The eye of the fabled cockatrice or\\nbasilisk was said to kill with a glance. Cf. _T.N._ iii. 4. 215: \"they\\nwill kill one another by the look, like two cockatrices;\" _Rich. III._\\niv. 1. 55:--\\n\\n  \"A cockatrice hast thou hatch\\'d to the world,\\n  Whose unavoided eye is murtherous,\" etc.\\n\\n49. _Those eyes._ That is, Romeo\\'s.\\n\\n51. _Determine of._ Decide. Cf. _2 Hen IV._ iv. 1. 164:--\\n\\n  \"To hear and absolutely to determine\\n  Of what conditions we shall stand upon.\"\\n\\nSee also _T.G. of V._ ii. 4. 181, _Rich. III._ iii. 4. 2, etc.\\n\\n53. _God save the mark!_ An exclamation of uncertain origin, commonly =\\nsaving your reverence, but sometimes, as here = God have mercy! Cf. _1\\nHen. IV._ i. 3. 56. So _God bless the mark_! in _M. of V._ ii. 2. 25,\\n_Oth._ i. 1. 33, etc.\\n\\n56. _Gore-blood._ Clotted blood. Forby remarks that the combination is\\nan East-Anglian provincialism. Halliwell-Phillipps cites Vicars, trans,\\nof _Virgil_, 1632: \"Whose hollow wound vented much black gore-bloud.\"\\n_Swounded_ is the reading of the 1st quarto; the other early eds. have\\n\"sounded,\" \"swouned,\" and \"swooned.\" In _R. of. L._ 1486 we have\\n\"swounds\" rhyming with \"wounds.\"\\n\\n57. _Bankrupt._ The early eds. have \"banckrout\" or \"bankrout,\" as often\\nin other passages and other writers of the time.\\n\\n64. _Contrary._ The adjective is accented by S. on the first or second\\nsyllable. Cf. _Ham._ iii. 2. 221, etc. For the verb, see on i. 5. 87\\nabove.\\n\\n73. _O serpent heart_, etc. Cf. _Macb._ i. 5. 66:--\\n\\n        \"look like the innocent flower,\\n  But be the serpent under it.\"\\n\\nMrs. Jameson remarks on this passage: \"This highly figurative and\\nantithetical exuberance of language is defended by Schlegel on strong\\nand just grounds; and to me also it appears natural, however critics may\\nargue against its taste or propriety. The warmth and vivacity of\\nJuliet\\'s fancy, which plays like a light over every part of her\\ncharacter--which animates every line she utters--which kindles every\\nthought into a picture, and clothes her emotions in visible images,\\nwould naturally, under strong and unusual excitement, and in the\\nconflict of opposing sentiments, run into some extravagance of diction.\"\\nCf. i. 1. 168 fol. above.\\n\\n83. _Was ever book_, etc. Cf. i. 3. 66 above.\\n\\n84. _O, that deceit_, etc. Cf. _Temp._ i. 2. 468: \"If the ill spirit\\nhave so fair a house,\" etc.\\n\\n86, 87. Mr. Fleay improves the metre by a slight transposition, which\\nMarshall adopts:--\\n\\n  \"No faith, no honesty in men; all naught,\\n  All perjur\\'d, all dissemblers, all forsworn;\"\\n\\nwhich may be what S. wrote.\\n\\n_Naught_ = worthless, bad. Cf. _Much Ado_, $1. $2. 157, _Hen. V._ i. 2.\\n73, etc. The word in this sense is usually spelt _naught_ in the early\\neds., but _nought_ when = nothing. _Dissemblers_ is here a\\nquadrisyllable. See p. 159 above.\\n\\n90. _Blister\\'d_, etc. \"Note the Nurse\\'s mistake of the mind\\'s audible\\nstruggle with itself for its decisions in _toto_\" (Coleridge).\\n\\n92. _Upon his brow_, etc. Steevens quotes Paynter: \"Is it possible that\\nunder such beautie and rare comelinesse, disloyaltie and treason may\\nhave their siedge and lodging?\" The image of shame _sitting_ on the brow\\nis not in Brooke\\'s poem.\\n\\n98. _Poor my lord._ Cf. \"sweet my mother,\" iii. 5. 198 below. The\\nfigurative meaning of _smooth_ is sufficiently explained by the\\nfollowing _mangle_. Cf. i. 5. 98 above, and see Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Ah cruell murthering tong, murthrer of others fame:\\n  How durst thou once attempt to tooch the honor of his name?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  Whether shall he (alas) poore banishd man, now flye?\\n  What place of succor shall he seeke beneth the starry skye?\\n  Synce she pursueth him, and him defames by wrong:\\n  That in distres should be his fort, and onely rampier strong.\"\\n\\n108. _Worser._ Cf. ii. 3. 29 above. S. uses it often, both as adjective\\nand adverb.\\n\\n112. _Banished._ Note how the trisyllabic pronunciation is emphatically\\nrepeated in this speech; as in Romeo\\'s in the next scene (19-50).\\n\\n116. _Sour woe delights_, etc. That is, \"misfortunes never come single.\"\\nCf. _Ham._ iv. 5. 78:--\\n\\n  \"When sorrows come, they come not single spies,\\n  But in battalions.\"\\n\\n117. _Needly will._ Needs must. _Needly_ was not coined by S., as some\\nhave supposed, being found in _Piers Plowman_ and other early English.\\nHe uses it only here.\\n\\n120. _Modern._ Trite, commonplace; the only meaning of the word in S.\\nSee _A.Y.L._ ii. 7. 156, _Macb._ iv. 3. 170, etc.\\n\\n121. _Rearward._ Cf. Sonn. 90. 6:--\\n\\n  \"Ah! do not, when my heart hath scap\\'d this sorrow,\\n  Come in the rearward of a conquer\\'d woe\"--\\n\\n(that is, to attack me anew); and _Much Ado_, iv. 1. 128:--\\n\\n  \"Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,\\n  Strike at thy life.\"\\n\\nThe metaphor is a military one, referring to a rear-guard or reserve\\nwhich follows up the attack of the vanguard or of the main army.\\n\\n126. _Sound._ Utter, express; or \"\\'to sound as with a plummet\\' is\\npossible\" (Dowden). _That word\\'s death_ = the death implied in that\\nword.\\n\\n130. _Wash they_, etc. That is, let them wash, etc. Some eds. put an\\ninterrogation mark after _tears_, as the 2d quarto does.\\n\\n137. _Wot._ Know; used only in the present tense and the participle\\n_wotting_.\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.--1. _Fearful._ Full of fear, afraid; Cf. _M.N.D._ v. 1. 101,\\n165, etc.\\n\\n2. _Parts._ Gifts, endowments. Cf. iii. 5. 181 below: \"honourable\\nparts.\"\\n\\n6. _Familiar._ A quadrisyllable here.\\n\\n7. _Sour company._ Cf. \"sour woe\" in iii. 2. 116 above, \"sour\\nmisfortune\" in v. 3. 82 below, etc. The figurative sense is a favourite\\none with S.\\n\\n10. _Vanish\\'d._ A singular expression, which Massinger has imitated in\\n_The Renegado_, v. 5: \"Upon those lips from which those sweet words\\nvanish\\'d.\" In _R. of L._ 1041 the word is used of the breath.\\n\\n20. _Exile._ For the variable accent (cf. 13 above and 43 below), see on\\niii. 1. 190.\\n\\n26. _Rush\\'d aside the law._ Promptly eluded or contravened the law. The\\nexpression is peculiar, and may be corrupt. \"Push\\'d\" and \"brush\\'d\" have\\nbeen suggested as emendations.\\n\\n28. _Dear mercy._ True mercy. Cf. _Much Ado_, i. 1. 129: \"A dear\\nhappiness to women,\" etc.\\n\\n29. _Heaven is here_, etc. \"All deep passions are a sort of atheists,\\nthat believe no future\" (Coleridge).\\n\\n33. _Validity._ Value, worth. Cf. _A.W._ v. 3. 192:--\\n\\n          \"O, behold this ring,\\n  Whose high respect and rich validity\\n  Did lack a parallel.\"\\n\\nSee also _T.N._ i. 1. 12 and _Lear_, i. 1. 83.\\n\\n34. _Courtship._ Courtesy, courtliness (as in _L. L. L._ v. 2. 363: \"Trim\\ngallants, full of courtship and of state,\" etc.); with the added idea of\\nprivilege of courting or wooing. For a similar blending of the two\\nmeanings, cf. _A.Y.L._ iii. 2. 364.\\n\\n38. _Who._ Cf. i. 1. 109 and i. 4. 97 above.\\n\\n42. _Free men._ Bitterly sarcastic.\\n\\n45. _Mean._ Often used by S. in the singular, though oftener in the\\nplural. Cf. _W.T._ iv. 4. 89:--\\n\\n  \"Yet nature is made better by no mean,\\n  But nature makes that mean,\" etc.\\n\\nSee also v. 3. 240 below.\\n\\n48. _Howling._ For the association with _hell_, cf. _2 Hen. IV._ ii. 4.\\n374 and _Ham._ v. 1. 265.\\n\\n49. _Confessor._ For the accent, see on ii. 6. 21 above.\\n\\n52. _Fond_ = foolish; as often in S. Cf. iv. 5. 78 below.\\n\\n55. _Adversity\\'s sweet milk._ Cf. _Macb._ iv. 3. 98: \"the sweet milk of\\nconcord,\" etc.\\n\\n59. _Displant._ Transplant. S. uses the word only here and in _Oth._ ii.\\n1. 283: \"the displanting of Cassio.\"\\n\\n60. _Prevails._ Avails. Cf. _unprevailing_ in _Ham._ i. 2. 107.\\n\\n62. _When that._ This use of _that_ as a \"conjunctional affix\" is\\ncommon. Cf. ii. 6. 25 above.\\n\\n63. _Dispute._ That is, reason. The verb is used transitively in a\\nsimilar sense in _W.T._ iv. 4. 411 and _Macb._ iv. 3. 220.\\n\\n70. _Taking the measure_, etc. Cf. _A.Y.L._ ii. 6. 2: \"Here lie I down,\\nand measure out my grave.\"\\n\\n77. _Simpleness._ Folly. Elsewhere = simplicity, innocence; as in _Much\\nAdo_, iii. 1. 70, _M.N.D._ v. 1. 83, etc. Cf. _simple_ in ii. 5. 38 and\\niii. 1. 35.\\n\\n85. _O woful sympathy_, etc. The early eds. give this speech to the\\nNurse. Farmer transferred it to the Friar, and is followed by most of\\nthe modern eds.\\n\\n90. _O._ Grief, affliction. In _Lear_, i. 4. 212, it means a cipher. It\\nis also used for anything circular; as marks of small-pox (_L. L. L._ v.\\n2. 45), stars (_M.N.D._ iii. 2. 188), a theatre (_Hen. V._ prol. 13),\\nand the earth (_A. and C._ v. 2. 81).\\n\\n94. _Old._ Practised, experienced. Cf. _L. L.

VIII._ i. 2. 2: \"the level Of a full-charg\\'d confederacy,\" etc.\\nCf. the use of the verb in _Much Ado_, ii. 1. 239, _Rich. III._ iv. 4.\\n202, etc.\\n\\n106. _Anatomy._ Contemptuous for body; as in _T.N._ iii. 2. 67.\\n\\n108. _Hold thy desperate hand!_ etc. Up to this point, as Marshall\\nremarks, the Friar \"treats Romeo\\'s utter want of self-control with a\\ngood-humoured tolerance.... It is only when the young man\\'s passion\\nthreatens to go to the point of violating the law of God and man that he\\nspeaks with the authority of a priest, and in the tone of stern rebuke.\\nThis speech is a most admirable composition, full of striking good\\nsense, eloquent reasoning, and noble piety.\"\\n\\n109. _Art thou_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Art thou quoth he a man? thy shape saith, so thou art:\\n  Thy crying and thy weping eyes, denote a womans hart.\\n  For manly reason is quite from of [off] thy mynd outchased,\\n  And in her stead affections lewd, and fancies highly placed.\\n  So that I stoode in doute this howre (at the least)\\n  If thou a man, or woman wert, or els a brutish beast.\"\\n\\n113. _Ill-beseeming._ Cf. i. 5. 76 above.\\n\\n115. _Better temper\\'d._ Of better temper or quality.

It is = transgressing in _Rich.\\nII._ v. 3. 66: \"thy digressing son.\"\\n\\n132. _Like powder_, etc. See on ii. 6. 10 above. Steevens remarks: \"The\\nancient English soldiers, using match-locks instead of flints, were\\nobliged to carry a lighted _match_ hanging at their belts, very near to\\nthe wooden _flask_ in which they kept their powder.\"\\n\\n134. _And thou_, etc. And thou torn to pieces with thine own means of\\ndefence.\\n\\n144. _Pout\\'st upon._ Cf. _Cor._ v. 1. 52: \"We pout upon the morning.\"\\n\\n151. _Blaze._ Make public.

Cf. _T of S._ i. 1. 87, 188, etc.\\n_Mew_ originally meant to moult, or shed the feathers; and as hawks were\\nthen shut up, it got the secondary sense it has here.\\n\\n12. _Desperate._ Overbold, venturesome.\\n\\n23. _Keep no great ado._ Elsewhere in S. the phrase is, as now, _make\\nado._ Cf. _T.G. of V._ iv. 4. 31, _1 Hen.

Cf. _Per._ ii. 1.\\n84: \"Now, afore me, a handsome fellow!\" So _before me_, as in _T.N._ ii.\\n3. 194, _Oth._ iv. 1. 149, etc.\\n\\n35. _By and by._ Presently. See on ii. 2. 151 above.\\n\\n\\nSCENE V.--_Juliet\\'s Chamber._ The scene is variously given by the\\neditors as \"The Garden,\" \"Anti-room of Juliet\\'s Chamber,\" \"Loggia to\\nJuliet\\'s Chamber,\" \"An open Gallery to Juliet\\'s Chamber overlooking the\\nOrchard,\" \"Juliet\\'s Bedchamber; a Window open upon the Balcony,\"\\n\"Capulet\\'s Orchard,\" etc. As Malone remarks, Romeo and Juliet probably\\nappeared in the balcony at the rear of the old English stage. \"The scene\\nin the poet\\'s eye was doubtless the large and massy projecting balcony\\nbefore one or more windows, common in Italian palaces and not unfrequent\\nin Gothic civil architecture. The _loggia_, an open gallery, or high\\nterrace [see cut on p. 85], communicating with the upper apartments of a\\npalace, is a common feature in Palladian architecture, and would also be\\nwell adapted to such a scene\" (Verplanck).\\n\\n4. _Nightly._ It is said that the nightingale, if undisturbed, sits and\\nsings upon the same tree for many weeks together (Steevens). This is\\nbecause the male bird sings near where the female is sitting. \"The\\npreference of the nightingale for the _pomegranate_ is unquestionable.\\n\\'The nightingale sings from the pomegranate groves in the daytime,\\' says\\nRussel in his account of Aleppo. A friend ... informs us that throughout\\nhis journeys in the East he never heard such a choir of nightingales as\\nin a row of pomegranate-trees that skirt the road from Smyrna to\\nBoudjia\" (Knight).\\n\\n8. _Lace._ Cf. _Macb._ ii. 3. 118: \"His silver skin lac\\'d with his\\ngolden blood;\" _Cymb._ ii. 2. 22:--\\n\\n        \"white and azure lac\\'d\\n  With blue of heaven\\'s own tinct,\" etc.\\n\\nSee on ii. 4. 44 above. We have the word used literally in _Much Ado_,\\niii. 4. 20: \"laced with silver.\" On _the severing clouds_, cf. _J.C._\\nii. 1. 103:--\\n\\n                  \"yon grey lines\\n  That fret the clouds are messengers of day;\"[6]\\n\\nand _Much Ado_, v. 3. 25: \"Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.\"\\n\\n9. _Night\\'s candles_, etc. Cf. _Macb._ ii. 1. 5.: \"Their candles are all\\nout.\" See also _M. of V._ v. 1. 220 and _Sonn._ 21. 12.\\n\\n13. _Some meteor_, etc. Cf. _1 Hen. IV._ ii. 4. 351: \"My lord, do you\\nsee these meteors? do you behold these exhalations?\" and _Id._ v. 1. 19:\\n\"an exhal\\'d meteor.\"\\n\\n14. _Torch-bearer._ See on i. 4. 11 above.\\n\\n[Footnote 6: At the meeting of the new Shakspere Society, Oct. 11, 1878,\\nthe chairman read a paper by Mr. Ruskin on the word _fret_ in this\\npassage. The following is from the report in the London _Academy_:--\\n\\n\"_Fret_ means primarily the rippling of the cloud--as sea by wind;\\nsecondarily, the breaking it asunder for light to come through. It\\nimplies a certain degree of vexation, some dissolution, much order, and\\nextreme beauty. The reader should have seen \\'Daybreak,\\' and think what\\nis broken and by what. The cloud of night is broken up, by Day, which\\nbreaks out, breaks in, as from heaven to earth, with a breach in the\\ncloud wall of it. The thing that the day breaks up is partly a garment\\n_rent_, the blanket of the dark torn to be peeped through....\"]\\n\\n19. _Yon grey._ See on ii. 4. 44 above.\\n\\n20. _The pale reflex of Cynthia\\'s brow._ That is, the pale light of the\\nmoon shining through or reflected from the breaking clouds _Brow_ is put\\nfor face, as in _M.N.D._ v. 1. 11: \"Helen\\'s beauty in a brow of Egypt,\"\\netc. Some critics have thought that a setting moon was meant; but only a\\nrising moon could light up \"the severing clouds\" in the way described.\\nThe _reflection_ (if we take _reflex_ in that literal sense) is from\\ntheir _edges_, as the light from behind falls upon them. Have these\\ncritics never seen--\\n\\n                        \"a sable cloud\\n  Turn forth her silver lining on the night\"\\n\\nwhen the moon was behind it?\\n\\n21. _Nor that is not._ Double negatives are common in S.\\n\\n22. _The vaulty heaven._ Cf. _K. John_, v. 2. 52: \"the vaulty top of\\nheaven;\" and _R. of L._ 119: \"her vaulty prison\" (that is, Night\\'s).\\n\\n29. _Division._ \"The breaking of a melody, or its descant, into small\\nnotes. The modern musician would call it variation\" (Elson). Cf. _1 Hen.\\nIV._ iii. 1. 210:--\\n\\n  \"Sung by a fair queen in a summer\\'s bower,\\n  With ravishing division, to her lute.\"\\n\\nThe word is a quadrisyllable here.\\n\\n31. _The lark_, etc. The toad having beautiful eyes, and the lark very\\nugly ones, it was a popular tradition that they had changed eyes.\\n(Warburton).\\n\\n33. _Affray._ Startle from sleep; as Chaucer in _Blaunche the Duchess_\\n(296) is _affrayed_ out of his sleep by \"smale foules\" (Dowden).\\n\\n34. _Hunt\\'s-up._ The tune played to wake and collect the hunters\\n(Steevens). Cf. Drayton, _Polyolbion_: \"But hunts-up to the morn the\\nfeather\\'d sylvans sing;\" and again in _Third Eclogue_: \"Time plays the\\nhunts-up to thy sleepy head.\" We have the full form in _T.A._ ii. 2. 1:\\n\"The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey.\" The term was also applied\\nto any morning song, and especially one to a new-married woman. Cotgrave\\n(ed. 1632) defines _resveil_ as \"a Hunts-up, or morning song, for a\\nnew-maried wife, the day after the mariage.\"\\n\\n43. _My lord_, etc. From 1st quarto; the other quartos and 1st folio\\nhave \"love, Lord, ay husband, friend,\" for which Dowden reads:\\n\"love-lord, ay, husband-friend.\" _Friend_ was sometimes = lover; as in\\n_Much Ado_, v. 2. 72, _Oth._ iv. 1. 3, _A. and C._ iii. 12. 22, _Cymb._\\ni. 4. 74, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem, where Juliet referring to Romeo,\\nsays:--\\n\\n  \"For whom I am becomme vnto my selfe a foe,\\n  Disdayneth me, his steadfast frend, and scornes my frendship so;\"\\n\\nand of their parting the poet says:--\\n\\n  \"With solemne othe they both theyr sorowfull leaue do take;\\n  They sweare no stormy troubles shall theyr steady friendship shake.\"\\n\\n44. _Day in the hour._ The hyperbole is explained by what follows.\\n\\n53. _I have an ill-divining soul._ \"This miserable prescience of\\nfuturity I have always regarded as a circumstance particularly\\nbeautiful. The same kind of warning from the mind Romeo seems to have\\nbeen conscious of, on his going to the entertainment at the house of\\nCapulet\" (Steevens). See i. 4. 48 and 103 fol. above.\\n\\n54. _Below._ From 1st quarto; the other early eds. have \"so lowe,\" which\\nis preferred by some of the modern editors.\\n\\n58. _Dry sorrow drinks our blood._ An allusion to the old notion that\\nsorrow and sighing exhaust the blood. Cf. _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 97, _Ham._\\niv. 7. 123, _Much Ado_, iii. 1. 78, etc.\\n\\n65. _Down._ Lying down, abed (Dowden).\\n\\n66. _Procures her._ Leads her to come. Cf. ii. 2. 145 above. See also\\n_M.W._ iv. 6. 48: \"procure the vicar To stay for me,\" etc.\\n\\n67. _Why, how now, Juliet!_ Mrs. Jameson remarks: \"In the dialogue\\nbetween Juliet and her parents, and in the scenes with the Nurse, we\\nseem to have before us the whole of her previous education and habits:\\nwe see her, on the one hand, kept in severe subjection by her austere\\nparents; and, on the other, fondled and spoiled by a foolish old\\nnurse--a situation perfectly accordant with the manners of the time.\\nThen Lady Capulet comes sweeping by with her train of velvet, her black\\nhood, her fan, and rosary--the very beau-ideal of a proud Italian matron\\nof the fifteenth century, whose offer to poison Romeo, in revenge for\\nthe death of Tybalt, stamps her with one very characteristic trait of\\nthe age and the country. Yet she loves her daughter, and there is a\\ntouch of remorseful tenderness in her lamentations over her, which adds\\nto our impression of the timid softness of Juliet and the harsh\\nsubjection in which she has been kept.\"\\n\\n69. _Wash him from his grave_, etc. The hyperbole may remind us of the\\none in _Rich. II._ iii. 3. 166 fol.\\n\\n72. _Wit._ See on iii. 3. 122 above.\\n\\n73. _Feeling._ Heartfelt. Cf. \"feeling sorrows\" in _W.T._ iv. 2. 8 and\\n_Lear_, iv. 6. 226.\\n\\n82. _Like he._ The inflections of pronouns are often confounded by S.\\n\\n84. _Ay, madam_, etc. Johnson remarks that \"Juliet\\'s equivocations are\\nrather too artful for a mind disturbed by the loss of a new lover.\" To\\nthis Clarke well replies: \"It appears to us that, on the contrary, the\\nevasions of speech here used by the young girl-wife are precisely those\\nthat a mind, suddenly and sharply awakened from previous inactivity, by\\ndesperate love and grief, into self-conscious strength, would\\ninstinctively use. Especially are they exactly the sort of shifts and\\nquibbles that a nature rendered timid by stinted intercourse with her\\nkind, and by communion limited to the innocent confidences made by one\\nof her age in the confessional, is prone to resort to, when first left\\nto itself in difficulties of situation and abrupt encounter with life\\'s\\nperplexities.\"\\n\\n87. _In Mantua_, etc. No critic, so far as I am aware, has noted the\\nslip of which S. is guilty here. Romeo is said to be _living_ in\\nMantua, but an hour has hardly elapsed since he started for that city;\\nand how can the lady know of the plan for his going there which was\\nsecretly suggested by the friar the afternoon before?\\n\\n89. _Shall give._ The ellipsis of the relative is not uncommon.\\n\\n92. _I never shall be satisfied_, etc. Daniel remarks: \"The several\\ninterpretations of which this ambiguous speech is capable are, I\\nsuppose: 1. I never shall be satisfied with Romeo; 2. I never shall be\\nsatisfied with Romeo till I behold him; 3. I never shall be satisfied\\nwith Romeo till I behold him dead; 4. Till I behold him, dead is my poor\\nheart; 5. Dead is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vext.\"\\n\\n96. _Temper._ Compound, mix. Cf. _Ham._ v. 2. 339: \"It is a poison\\ntemper\\'d by himself;\" _Cymb._ v. 250: \"To temper poisons for her,\" etc.\\n\\n97. _That._ So that; as often. _Receipt_ is not elsewhere applied by S.\\nto the _receiving_ of food or drink, though it is used of _what is\\nreceived_ in _R. of L._ 703 and _Cor._ i. 1. 116.\\n\\n100. _Cousin._ Some editors add \"Tybalt\" (from 2d folio) to fill out the\\nmeasure.\\n\\n104. _Needy._ Joyless. The word is = needful in _Per._ i. 4. 95: \"needy\\nbread.\"\\n\\n105. _They._ S. makes _tidings_, like _news_ (cf. ii. 5. 22 with ii. 5.\\n35), either singular or plural. Cf. _J.C._ iv. 3. 155: \"That tidings;\"\\n_Id._ v. 3. 54: \"These tidings,\" etc.\\n\\n108. _Sorted out._ Cf. _1. Hen. VI._ ii. 3. 27: \"I\\'ll sort some other\\ntime to visit you,\" etc.\\n\\n109. _Nor I look\\'d not._ See on iii. 5. 21 above.\\n\\n110. _In happy time._ Schmidt explains this as here = \"_Ã  propos_, pray\\ntell me.\" Elsewhere it is = just in time; as in _A.W._ v. 1. 6, _Ham._\\nv. 2. 214, _Oth._ iii. 1. 32, etc.\\n\\n113. _County._ See on i. 3. 83 above.\\n\\n120. _I swear._ Collier thinks these words \"hardly consistent with\\nJuliet\\'s character;\" but, as Ulrici remarks, \"they seem necessary in\\norder to show her violent excitement, and thereby explain her conduct.\"\\nThey appear to crowd the measure, but possibly \"I will not marry yet\"\\n(\"I\\'ll not marry yet\") may count only as two feet.\\n\\n122. _These are news._ See on 105 above.\\n\\n125. _The air._ The reading of the 4th and 5th quartos; the other early\\neds. have \"the earth,\" which is adopted by many editors. Hudson remarks:\\n\"This is scientifically true; poetically, it would seem better to read\\n_air_ instead of _earth_.\" It happens, however, that science and poetry\\nagree here; for it is the watery vapour in the _air_ that is condensed\\ninto dew. Malone, who also says that the reading _earth_ is\\n\"philosophically true,\" cites _R. of L._ 1226: \"But as the earth doth\\nweep, the sun being set;\" but this only means that the earth is wet with\\ndew. To speak of the earth as _drizzling_ dew is nonsense; we might as\\nwell say that it \"drizzles rain\" (_Much Ado_, iii. 3. 111). Elsewhere S.\\nrefers to the \"falling\" dew; as in _K. John_, ii. 1. 285, _Hen. VIII._\\ni. 3. 57, _Cymb._ v. 5. 351, etc.\\n\\n128. _Conduit._ Probably alluding to the human figures that spouted\\nwater in fountains. Cf. _R. of L._ 1234:--\\n\\n  \"A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,\\n  Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling.\"\\n\\nSee also _W.T._ v. 2. 60.\\n\\n129-136. _Evermore ... body._ This long-drawn \"conceit\" is evidently\\nfrom the first draught of the play.\\n\\n134. _Who._ See on i. 1. 109 above.\\n\\n138. _She will none._ Cf. _M.N.D._ iii. 2. 169: \"Lysander, keep thy\\nHermia; I will none,\" etc.\\n\\n140. _Take me with you._ Let me understand you. Cf. _1 Hen. IV._ ii. 4.\\n506: \"I would your grace would take me with you; whom means your grace?\"\\n\\n143. _Wrought._ \"Not = induced, prevailed upon, but brought about,\\neffected\" (Schmidt). Cf. _Henry VIII._ iii. 2. 311: \"You wrought to be a\\ndelegate;\" _Cor._ ii. 3. 254: \"wrought To be set high in place,\" etc.\\n\\n144. _Bridegroom._ The 2d quarto has \"Bride.\" This was used of both\\nsexes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but S. never makes it\\nmasculine. _The New Eng. Dict._ quotes Sylvester, _Du Bartas_ (1598):\\n\"Daughter dear ... Isis bless thee and thy Bride,\" etc.\\n\\n148. _Chop-logic._ Sophist; used by S. only here.\\n\\n150. _Minion._ Originally = favourite, darling (as in _Temp._ iv. 1. 98,\\n_Macb._ i. 2. 19, etc.), then a spoiled favourite, and hence a pert or\\nsaucy person.\\n\\n151. _Thank me no thankings_, etc. Cf. _Rich. II._ ii. 3. 87: \"Grace me\\nno grace, nor uncle me no uncle,\" etc.\\n\\n152. _Fettle._ Prepare, make ready. It is the reading of the quartos and\\n1st folio; the later folios have \"settle,\" which may be what S. wrote.\\nHe does not use _fettle_ elsewhere, and the long _s_ and _f_ were easily\\nconfounded in printing.\\n\\n155. _Out_, etc. \"Such was the indelicacy of the age of S. that authors\\nwere not contented only to employ these terms of abuse in their own\\noriginal performances, but even felt no reluctance to introduce them in\\ntheir versions of the most chaste and elegant of the Greek or Roman\\npoets. Stanyhurst, the translator of Virgil, in 1582, makes Dido call\\nÃ†neas _hedge-brat_, _cullion_, and _tar-breech_ in the course of one\\nspeech. Nay, in the interlude of _The Repentance of Mary Magdalene_,\\n1567, Mary Magdalene says to one of her attendants, \\'_Horeson_, I\\nbeshrowe your heart, are you here?\\'\" (Steevens).\\n\\n164. _Lent._ The 1st quarto has \"sent,\" which some editors adopt. Clarke\\nthinks it may be a misprint for \"left,\" as Capulet (i. 2. 14) speaks as\\nif he had had other children; but S. is careless in these minor matters.\\nSee on i. 5. 30 and v. 3. 207.\\n\\n167. _Hilding._ See on ii. 4. 43 above.\\n\\n171. _God ye god-den._ See on i. 2. 57 above.\\n\\n172. _Peace._ Theobald repeated the word for the sake of the measure.\\n_Peace_ may perhaps be metrically a dissyllable, as in _A.Y.L._ ii. 4.\\n70.\\n\\n175-177. _God\\'s bread!_ etc. The text of the early eds. is evidently\\ncorrupt here. The reading in the text is Malone\\'s, and perhaps gives\\nvery nearly what S. wrote on the revision of the play.\\n\\n181. _Stuff\\'d_, etc. Cf. _Much Ado_, i. 1. 56: \"stuffed with all\\nhonourable virtues,\" etc. For _parts_, cf. iii. 3. 2 above.\\n\\n184. _Mammet._ Puppet, doll. Cf. _1 Hen. IV._ ii. 3. 95: \"To play with\\nmammets.\" The word is also written _mawmet_, and is a contraction of\\n_Mahomet_. _In her fortune\\'s tender_ = when good fortune presents\\nitself. Cf. iii. 4. 12 above.\\n\\n189. _Use._ See on ii. chor. 10 above.\\n\\n190. _Lay hand on heart, advise._ Consider it seriously. Cf. Brooke\\'s\\npoem:--\\n\\n  \"Aduise thee well, and say that thou art warned now,\\n  And thinke not that I speake in sporte, or mynd to breake my vowe.\"\\n\\n198. _Sweet my mother._ Cf. iii. 2. 98: \"Ah, poor my lord,\" etc.\\n\\n209. _Should practise stratagems_, etc. Should, as it were, entrap me\\ninto so painful and perplexing a situation. Schmidt makes _stratagem_\\nsometimes = \"anything amazing and appalling,\" and cites this passage as\\nan instance.\\n\\n212. _Faith, here \\'tis_, etc. S. here follows Brooke:--\\n\\n  \"She setteth foorth at large the fathers furious rage,\\n  And eke she prayseth much to her the second mariage;\\n  And County Paris now she praiseth ten times more,\\n  By wrong, then she her selfe by right had Romeus praysde before,\" etc.\\n\\nMrs. Jameson remarks: \"The old woman, true to her vocation, and fearful\\nlest her share in these events should be discovered, counsels her to\\nforget Romeo and marry Paris; and the moment which unveils to Juliet the\\nweakness and baseness of her confidante is the moment which reveals her\\nto herself. She does not break into upbraidings; it is no moment for\\nanger; it is incredulous amazement, succeeded by the extremity of scorn\\nand abhorrence, which takes possession of her mind. She assumes at once\\nand asserts all her own superiority, and rises to majesty in the\\nstrength of her despair.\"\\n\\n220. _Green._ We have green eyes again in _M.N.D._ v. 1. 342: \"His eyes\\nwere green as leeks.\" Cf. _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, v. 1: \"With that rare\\ngreen eye.\" Clarke remarks: \"The brilliant touch of green visible in\\nvery light hazel eyes, and which gives wonderful clearness and animation\\nto their look, has been admiringly denoted by various poets from time\\nimmemorial.\" In a sonnet by Drummond of Hawthornden, the gods are\\nrepresented as debating of what colour a beauty\\'s eyes shall be. Mars\\nand Apollo vote for black:--\\n\\n  \"Chaste PhÅ“be spake for purest azure dyes,\\n  But Jove and Venus green about the light,\\n  To frame thought best, as bringing most delight,\\n  That to pin\\'d hearts hope might for aye arise.\"\\n\\nCf. Longfellow, _The Spanish Student_: \"Ay, soft emerald eyes;\" and\\nagain:--\\n\\n                      \"in her tender eyes\\n  Just that soft shade of green we sometimes see\\n  In evening skies.\"\\n\\nIn a note on the former passage, the poet says: \"The Spaniards, with\\ngood reason, consider this colour of the eyes as beautiful, and\\ncelebrate it in song.... Dante speaks of Beatrice\\'s eyes as emeralds\\n(_Purgat._ xxxi. 116). Lami says in his _Annotazioni_, \\'Erano i suoi\\nocchi d\\' un turchino verdiccio, simile a quel del mare.\\'\"\\n\\n221. _Beshrew._ See on ii. 5. 52 above.\\n\\n225. _Here._ Not referring to Verona, but = \"in this world\" (Johnson).\\n\\n233. _Ancient damnation._ The abstract for the concrete, explained by\\nwhat follows. Steevens cites _The Malcontent_, 1604: \"out, you ancient\\ndamnation!\"\\n\\n234. _Is it more sin_, etc. Mrs. Jameson remarks: \"It appears to me an\\nadmirable touch of nature, considering the master-passion which, at this\\nmoment, rules in Juliet\\'s soul, that she is as much shocked by the\\nnurse\\'s dispraise of her lover as by her wicked, time-serving advice.\\nThis scene is the crisis in the character; and henceforth we see Juliet\\nassume a new aspect. The fond, impatient, timid girl puts on the wife\\nand the woman: she has learned heroism from suffering, and subtlety from\\noppression. It is idle to criticise her dissembling submission to her\\nfather and mother; a higher duty has taken place of that which she owed\\nto them; a more sacred tie has severed all others. Her parents are\\npictured as they are, that no feeling for them may interfere in the\\nslightest degree with our sympathy for the lovers. In the mind of Juliet\\nthere is no struggle between her filial and her conjugal duties, and\\nthere ought to be none.\"\\n\\n236. _Compare._ See on ii. 5. 43 above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\n\\nSCENE I.--3. _And I am nothing slow to slack his haste._ Paris here\\nseems to say the opposite of what he evidently means, and various\\nattempts have been made to explain away the inconsistency. It appears to\\nbe one of the peculiar cases of \"double negative\" discussed by Schmidt\\nin his Appendix, p. 1420, though he does not give it there. \"The idea of\\nnegation was so strong in the poet\\'s mind that he expressed it in more\\nthan one place, unmindful of his canon that \\'your four negatives make\\nyour two affirmatives.\\'\" Cf. _Lear_, ii. 4. 142:--\\n\\n  \"You less know how to value her desert\\n  Than she to scant [\"slack\" in quartos] her duty;\"\\n\\nthat is, you are more inclined to depreciate her than she to scant her\\nduty.\\n\\n5. _Uneven._ Indirect. Cf. the use of _even_ in _Ham._ ii. 2. 298: \"be\\neven and direct with me,\" etc. Sometimes the word is = perplexing,\\nembarrassing; as in _1 Hen. IV._ i. 1. 50: \"uneven and unwelcome news,\"\\netc.\\n\\n11. _Marriage._ A trisyllable here; as in _M. of V._ ii. 9. 13, etc. So\\nalso in the quotation from Brooke in note on iii. 5. 212 above.\\n\\n13. _Alone._ When alone; opposed to _society_ below.\\n\\n16. _Slow\\'d._ The only instance of the verb in S.\\n\\n18-36. This part of the scene evidently came from the first draft of the\\nplay.\\n\\n20. _That may be must be._ That _may be_ of yours must be.\\n\\n29. _Abus\\'d._ Marred, disfigured.\\n\\n31. _Spite._ Cf. i. 5. 64 above.\\n\\n38. _Evening mass._ Ritson and others say that Juliet means _vespers_,\\nas there is no such thing as _evening mass_; and Staunton expresses\\nsurprise that S. has fallen into this error, since he elsewhere shows a\\nfamiliarity with the usages of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the\\ncritics who are in error, not S. Walafrid Strabo (_De Rebus Eccles._\\nxxiii.) says that, while the time for mass is regularly before noon, it\\nis sometimes celebrated in the evening (\"aliquando _ad vesperam_\").\\nAmalarius, Bishop of TrÃ¨ves (_De Eccles. Off._ iv. 40), specifies Lent\\nas the season for this hour. The _Generales RubricÃ¦_ allow this at other\\ntimes in the year. In Winkles\\'s _French Cathedrals_, we are told that,\\non the occasion of the marriage of Henrietta of France, daughter of\\nHenry IV., with the Duke of Chevreuse, as proxy for Charles I. of\\nEngland, celebrated in Notre Dame at Paris, May 11, 1625, \"mass was\\ncelebrated in the evening.\" See _Notes and Queries_ for April 29 and\\nJune 3, 1876; also M\\'Clintock and Strong\\'s _Biblical CyclopÃ¦dia_, under\\n_Mass._\\n\\n40. _We must entreat_, etc. We must beg you to leave us to ourselves.\\nCf. _Hen. VIII._ i. 4. 71:--\\n\\n  \"Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat\\n  An hour of revels with them.\"\\n\\n41. _God shield._ God forbid. Cf. _A.W._ i. 3. 74: \"God shield you mean\\nit not.\" So \"Heaven shield,\" in _M. for M._ iii. 1. 141, etc. _Devotion_\\nis here a quadrisyllable.\\n\\n45. _Past cure_, etc. Cf. _L. L. L._ v. 2. 28: \"past cure is still past\\ncare.\"\\n\\n48. _Prorogue._ See on ii. 2. 78 above.\\n\\n54. _This knife._ It was the custom of the time in Italy as in Spain for\\nladies to wear daggers at their girdles.\\n\\n57. _The label._ The seal appended by a slip to a deed, according to the\\ncustom of the day. In _Rich. II._ v. 2. 56, the Duke of York discovers,\\nby the depending seal, a covenant which his son has made with the\\nconspirators. In _Cymb._ v. 5. 430, _label_ is used for the deed itself.\\n\\n62. _Extremes._ Extremities, sufferings. Cf. _R. of L._ 969:--\\n\\n  \"Devise extremes beyond extremity,\\n  To make him curse this cursed crimeful night.\"\\n\\nThe meaning of the passage is, \"This knife shall decide the struggle\\nbetween me and my distresses\" (Johnson).\\n\\n64. _Commission._ Warrant, authority. Cf. _A.W._ ii. 3. 279: \"you are\\nmore saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of\\nyour birth and virtue gives you heraldry.\"\\n\\n66. _Be not so long to speak._ So slow to speak. Clarke remarks here:\\n\"The constraint, with sparing speech, visible in Juliet when with her\\nparents, as contrasted with her free outpouring flow of words when she\\nis with her lover, her father confessor, or her nurse--when, in short,\\nshe is her natural self and at perfect ease--is true to characteristic\\ndelineation. The young girl, the very young girl, the girl brought up as\\nJuliet has been reared, the youthful Southern maiden, lives and breathes\\nin every line by which S. has set her before us.\"\\n\\n78. _Yonder._ Ulrici \"cannot perceive why Juliet must designate a\\nparticular, actual tower, since all that follows is purely imaginary;\"\\nbut to me the reference to a tower in sight seems both forcible and\\nnatural, and the transition to imaginary ordeals is equally natural.\\n\\n83. _Reeky._ Reeking with foul vapours, or simply = foul, as if soiled\\nwith smoke or _reek_. Cf. _reechy_ (another form of the same word) in\\n_Much Ado_, iii. 3. 143, _Ham._ iii. 4. 184, etc.\\n\\n93. _Take thou this vial_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Receiue this vyoll small and keepe it as thine eye;\\n  And on the mariage day, before the sunne doe cleare the skye,\\n  Fill it with water full vp to the very brim,\\n  Then drinke it of, and thou shalt feele throughout eche vayne and lim\\n  A pleasant slumber slide, and quite dispred at length\\n  On all thy partes, from euery part reue all thy kindly strength;\\n  Withouten mouing thus thy ydle parts shall rest,\\n  No pulse shall goe, ne hart once beate within thy hollow brest,\\n  But thou shalt lye as she that dyeth in a traunce:\\n  Thy kinsmen and thy trusty frendes shall wayle the sodain chaunce;\\n  The corps then will they bring to graue in this church yarde,\\n  Where thy forefathers long agoe a costly tombe preparde,\\n  Both for them selfe and eke for those that should come after,[7]\\n  Both deepe it is, and long and large, where thou shalt rest, my daughter,\\n  Till I to Mantua sende for Romeus, thy knight;\\n  Out of the tombe both he and I will take thee forth that night.\"\\n\\n97. _Surcease._ Cf. _R. of L._ 1766: \"If they surcease to be that should\\nsurvive;\" and _Cor._ iii. 2. 121: \"Lest I surcease to honour mine own\\ntruth.\" For the noun, see _Macb._ i. 7. 74.\\n\\n100. _Paly._ Cf. _Hen. V._ iv. chor. 8: \"paly flames;\" and 2 _Hen. VI._\\niii. 2. 141: \"his paly lips.\"\\n\\n105. _Two and forty hours._ It is difficult to make this period agree\\nwith the time of the events that follow. Maginn would read \"two and\\nfifty hours;\" and \"two and thirty\" has been suggested, which is more in\\naccordance with the dates given in the play. In iv. 1. 90 the Friar says\\nto Juliet:--\\n\\n                  \"_Wednesday_ is to-morrow:\\n  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,\" etc.\\n\\n[Footnote 7: For the rhyme of _after_ and _daughter_, cf. _T. of S._ i.\\n1. 245, 246, _W.T._ iv. 1. 27, 28, and _Lear_, i. 4. 341, 344.]\\n\\nThis agrees with the preceding dates. The conversation in iii. 4 is late\\non Monday evening (cf. lines 5 and 18), and Lady Capulet\\'s talk with\\nJuliet about marrying Paris (iii. 5. 67 fol.) is early the next\\n(Tuesday) morning. The visit to the Friar is evidently on the same day;\\nand the next scene (iv. 2) is in the evening of that day. Juliet comes\\nhome and tells her father that she has been to the Friar\\'s, and is ready\\nto marry Paris. The old man at once decides to have the wedding\\n\"to-morrow morning\" (that is, Wednesday) instead of Thursday. Lady\\nCapulet objects, but finally yields to her husband\\'s persistency; and so\\nJuliet goes to her chamber, and drinks the potion on _Tuesday_ evening,\\nor twenty-four hours earlier than the Friar had directed. He of course\\nis notified of the change in the time for the wedding, as he is to\\nperform the ceremony, and will understand that Juliet has anticipated\\nthe time of taking the potion, and that she will wake on _Thursday_\\nmorning instead of Friday. If so, instead of extending the \"two and\\nforty hours,\" as Maginn does, we need rather to shorten the interval. We\\nmay suppose the time of v. 3 to be as early as three o\\'clock in the\\nmorning. It is summer, and before daylight. Paris and Romeo come with\\ntorches, and the Friar with a lantern. Romeo tells his servant to\\ndeliver the letter to his father \"early in the morning.\" The night\\nwatchmen are still on duty. Since we can hardly send Juliet to bed\\nbefore nine in the evening on Tuesday, _thirty_ hours is the most that\\ncan be allowed for the interval, unless we add another day and accept\\nthe fifty-two of Maginn. But this does not seem required by anything in\\nact v.--not even by the \"two days buried\" of v. 3. 176, for Thursday\\nwould be the second day that she had lain in the tomb. The marriage was\\nto be early on Wednesday morning, and the funeral took its place.\\nBalthasar \"presently took post\" (v. 1. 21) to tell the news to Romeo at\\nMantua, less than twenty-five miles distant. He arrives before evening\\n(cf. v. 1. 4: \"all this day,\" which indicates the time), and Romeo at\\nonce says, \"I will hence _to-night_.\" He has ample time to make his\\npreparations and to reach Verona before two o\\'clock the next morning. He\\nhas been at the tomb only half an hour or so (v. 3. 130) before the\\nFriar comes. It must have been near midnight (see v. 2. 23) when Friar\\nJohn returned to Laurence\\'s cell; so that, even if he had not been\\ndespatched to Mantua until that morning, he would have had time to go\\nand return, but for his unexpected detention. I see no difficulty,\\ntherefore, in assuming that the drama closes on Thursday morning; the\\ndifficulty would be in prolonging the time to the next morning without\\nmaking the action drag.\\n\\n110. _In thy best robes_, etc. The Italian custom here alluded to, of\\ncarrying the dead body to the grave richly dressed and with the face\\n_uncovered_ (which is not mentioned by Paynter), S. found particularly\\ndescribed in _Romeus and Juliet_:--\\n\\n  \"Now throughout Italy this common vse they haue,\\n  That all the best of euery stocke are earthed in one graue;\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  An other vse there is, that whosoeuer dyes,\\n  Borne to their church with open face vpon the beere he lyes,\\n  In wonted weede attyrde, not wrapt in winding sheete.\"\\n\\nCf. _Ham._ iv. 5. 164: \"They bore him barefac\\'d on the bier.\" Knight\\nremarks that thus the maids and matrons of Italy are still carried to\\nthe tomb; and he quotes Rogers, _Italy_:--\\n\\n                \"And lying on her funeral couch,\\n  Like one asleep, her eyelids closed, her hands\\n  Folded together on her modest breast\\n  As \\'twere her nightly posture, through the crowd\\n  She came at last--and richly, gaily clad,\\n  As for a birthday feast.\"\\n\\n114. _Drift._ Scheme. Cf. ii. 3. 55 above.\\n\\n119. _Inconstant toy._ Fickle freak or caprice. Cf. _Ham._ i. 3. 5: \"a\\nfashion and a toy in blood;\" _Id._ 1. 4. 75: \"toys of desperation;\"\\n_Oth._ iii. 4. 156: \"no jealous toy,\" etc. _Inconstant toy_ and\\n_womanish fear_ are both from Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Cast of from thee at once the weede of womannish dread,\\n  With manly courage arme thy selfe from heele vnto the head;\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  God graunt he so confirme in thee thy present will,\\n  That no inconstant toy thee let [hinder] thy promesse to fulfill.\"\\n\\n121. _Give me, give me!_ Cf. _Macb._ i. 3. 5: \"\\'Give me,\\' quoth I.\"\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.--2. _Twenty cunning cooks._ Ritson says: \"Twenty cooks for\\nhalf a dozen guests! Either Capulet has altered his mind strangely, or\\nS. forgot what he had just made him tell us\" (iii. 4. 27). But, as\\nKnight remarks, \"Capulet is evidently a man of ostentation; but his\\nostentation, as is most generally the case, is covered with a thin veil\\nof indifference.\" Cf. i. 5. 124: \"We have a trifling foolish banquet\\ntowards.\"\\n\\nAccording to an entry in the books of the Stationers\\' Company for 1560,\\nthe preacher was paid six shillings and twopence for his labour; the\\nminstrel, twelve shillings; and the cook, fifteen shillings. But, as Ben\\nJonson tells us, a master cook is--\\n\\n                        \"a man of men\\n  For a professor; he designs, he draws,\\n  He paints, he carves, he builds, he fortifies,\\n  Makes citadels of curious fowl and fish.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  He is an architect, an engineer,\\n  A soldier, a physician, a philosopher,\\n  A general mathematician.\"\\n\\n6. _\\'Tis an ill cook_, etc. Cf. Puttenham, _Arte of English Poesie_,\\n1589:--\\n\\n  \"As the old cocke crowes so doeth the chick:\\n  A bad cooke that cannot his owne fingers lick.\"\\n\\n14. _Harlotry._ S. uses the noun only in this concrete sense: literally\\nin _Oth._ iv. 2. 239; and in a loose contemptuous way, as here (= silly\\nwench), in 1 _Hen. IV._ iii. 1. 198: \"a peevish, self-willed harlotry,\\none that no persuasion can do good upon.\" For _peevish_ = foolish,\\nchildish, cf. _A.Y.L._ iii. 5. 110, _M.W._ i. 4. 14, etc.\\n\\n17. _Learn\\'d me._ Taught myself, learned; not elsewhere used reflexively\\nby S. Cf. iii. 2. 12 above.\\n\\n18. _In disobedient opposition._ This line has but two regular accents,\\nthe others being metrical. See p. 159 above. _Opposition_ has five\\nsyllables.\\n\\n26. _Becomed._ Becoming. Cf. \"lean-look\\'d\" = lean-looking in _Rich. II._\\nii. 4. 11, \"well-spoken\" in _Rich. III._ i. 3. 348, etc. We still say\\n\"well-behaved.\"\\n\\n33. _Closet._ Chamber; as in _Ham._ ii. 1. 77, iii. 2. 344, iii. 3. 27,\\netc. Cf. _Matthew_, vi. 6.\\n\\n34. _Sort._ Select. Cf. iii. 5. 108 above.\\n\\n38. _Short in our provision._ Very feminine and housewifely! Cf. _Lear_,\\nii. 4. 208:--\\n\\n  \"I am now from home, and out of that provision\\n  Which shall be needful for your entertainment.\"\\n\\n41. _Deck up her._ Such transpositions are not rare in S. The 1st quarto\\nhas \"prepare up him\" in 45 just below.\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.--5. _Cross._ Perverse. Cf. _Hen. VIII._ iii. 2. 214:--\\n\\n                      \"what cross devil\\n  Made me put this main secret in the packet\\n  I sent the king?\"\\n\\n8. _Behoveful._ Befitting; used by S. nowhere else.\\n\\n15. _Thrills._ The ellipsis is somewhat peculiar from the fact that the\\nrelative is expressed in the next line. We should expect \"thrilling\" or\\n\"And almost.\"\\n\\n23. _Lie thou there._ See on iv. 1. 54 above. Moreover, as Steevens\\nnotes, _knives_, or daggers, were part of the accoutrements of a bride.\\nCf. Dekker, _Match me in London_: \"See at my girdle hang my wedding\\nknives!\" and _King Edward III._, 1599: \"Here by my side do hang my\\nwedding knives,\" etc. Dyce remarks that the omission of the word _knife_\\n\"is peculiarly awkward, as Juliet has been addressing the vial just\\nbefore;\" but S. wrote for the stage, where the action would make the\\nreference perfectly clear.\\n\\n27. _Because he married me_, etc. A \"female\" line with two extra\\nsyllables; like v. 3. 256 below. See p. 158 above.\\n\\n29. _Tried._ Proved; as in _J.C._ iv. 1. 28, _Ham._ i. 3. 62, etc.\\n\\n34. _Healthsome._ Wholesome; used by S. only here.\\n\\n36. _Like._ Likely; as often.\\n\\n39. _As in a vault_, etc. _As_ is here = to wit, namely. Cf. _Ham._ i.\\n4. 25, etc.\\n\\nSteevens thinks that this passage may have been suggested to S. by the\\nancient charnel-house (now removed) adjoining the chancel of Stratford\\nchurch; but that was merely a receptacle for bones from old graves and\\ndisused tombs, while the reference here is to a family tomb still in\\nregular use, where the body of Tybalt has just been deposited, and as\\nJuliet knows that she also will be when supposed to be dead. S. was of\\ncourse familiar with such tombs or _vaults_.\\n\\n_Receptacle._ For the accent on the first syllable, cf. _T.A._ i. 1. 92:\\n\"O sacred receptacle of my joys!\" So also in _Per._ iv. 6. 186; the only\\nother instance of the word in S.\\n\\n42. _Green._ Fresh, recent; as in _Ham._ i. 2. 2, etc.\\n\\n43. _Festering._ Corrupting; as in _Hen. V._ iv. 3. 88 and _Sonn._ 94.\\n14.\\n\\n47. _Mandrakes\\'._ The plant _Atropa mandragora_ (cf. _Oth._ iii. 3. 130\\nand _A. and C._ i. 5. 4, where it is called \"mandragora\"), the root of\\nwhich was thought to resemble the human figure, and when torn from the\\nearth to utter shrieks which drove those mad who heard them. Cf. 2 _Hen.\\nVI._ iii. 2. 310: \"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake\\'s groans,\"\\netc. Coles, in his _Art of Simpling_, says that witches \"take likewise\\nthe roots of mandrake, ... and make thereof an ugly image, by which they\\nrepresent the person on whom they intend to exercise their witchcraft.\"\\nThe plant was of repute also in medicine, as a soporific (see the\\npassages noted above in which it is called _mandragora_) and for sundry\\nother purposes. Sir Thomas More observes that \"Mandragora is an herbe,\\nas phisycions saye, that causeth folke to slepe, and therein to have\\nmany mad fantastical dreames.\" How the root could be got without danger\\nis explained by Bullein, in his _Bulwark of Defence against Sicknesse_,\\n1575: \"Therefore they did tye some dogge or other lyving beast unto the\\nroote thereof wythe a corde, and digged the earth in compasse round\\nabout, and in the meane tyme stopped their own eares for feare of the\\nterreble shriek and cry of this Mandrack. In whych cry it doth not only\\ndye it selfe, but the feare thereof kylleth the dogge or beast which\\npulleth it out of the earth.\"\\n\\n49. _Distraught._ Distracted. S. uses the word again in _Rich. III._\\niii. 5. 4: \"distraught and mad with terror.\" Elsewhere he has\\n_distracted_ (as in _Temp._ v. i. 12, _Macb._ ii. 3. 110, etc.) or\\n_distract_ (as in _J.C._ iv. 3. 155, _Ham._ iv. 5. 2, etc.). Spenser has\\n_distraught_ often; as in _F.Q._ iv. 3. 48: \"Thus whilest their minds\\nwere doubtfully distraught;\" _Id._ iv. 7. 31: \"His greedy throte,\\ntherewith in two distraught\" (where it is = drawn apart, its original\\nsense), etc.\\n\\n58. _Romeo, I come_, etc. The 1st quarto has here the stage-direction,\\n\"_She fals vpon her bed within the Curtaines_.\" The ancient stage was\\ndivided by curtains, called _traverses_, which were a substitute for\\nsliding scenes. Juliet\\'s bed was behind these curtains, and when they\\nwere closed in front of the bed the stage was supposed to represent the\\nhall in Capulet\\'s house for the next scene. When he summons the Nurse to\\ncall forth Juliet, she opens the curtains and the scene again becomes\\nJuliet\\'s chamber, where she is discovered apparently dead. After the\\nlamentations over her, the 1st quarto gives the direction, \"_They all\\nbut the Nurse goe foorth, casting Rosemary on her and shutting the\\nCurtens_;\" and then follows the scene with Peter and the Musicians. The\\nstage had no movable painted scenery.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSCENE IV.--2. _Pastry._ That is, the room where pastry was made. Cf.\\n_pantry_ (Fr. _paneterie_, from _pain_), the place where bread is kept,\\netc. Staunton quotes _A Floorish upon Fancie_, 1582:--\\n\\n  \"Now having seene all this, then shall you see hard by\\n  The pastrie, mealehouse, and the roome whereas the coales do ly.\"\\n\\nS. uses _pastry_ only here. For the double meaning of the word, cf.\\n_spicery_ (Fr. _Ã©picerie_), which was used both for the material (_Rich.\\nIII._ iv. 4. 424) and the place where it was kept.\\n\\n4. _Curfew-bell._ As the curfew was rung in the evening, the only way to\\nexplain this is to assume that it means \"the bell ordinarily used for\\nthat purpose\" (Schmidt). In the three other instances in which S. has\\nthe word (_Temp._ v. 1. 40, _M. for M._ iv. 2. 78, _Lear_, iii. 4. 121),\\nit is used correctly.\\n\\n5. _Bak\\'d meats._ Pastry. S. uses the term only here and in _Ham._ i. 2.\\n180. Nares says that it formerly meant \"a meat pie, or perhaps any other\\npie.\" He cites Cotgrave, who defines _pastisserie_ as \"all kind of pies\\nor bak\\'d meats;\" and Sherwood (English supplement to Cotgrave), who\\nrenders \"bak\\'d meats\" by _pastisserie_. Cf. _The White Devil:_--\\n\\n                \"You speak as if a man\\n  Should know what fowl is coffin\\'d in a bak\\'d meat\\n  Afore it is cut up;\"\\n\\nthat is, what fowl is under the crust of the pie. _Good Angelica_\\nperhaps means Lady Capulet, not the Nurse; and, as Dowden suggests,\\n_Spare not the cost_ seems more appropriate to the former. It may,\\nhowever, be the Nurse, who here seems to be treated as a kitchen\\nservant--perhaps to avoid the introduction of another character.\\n\\n6. _Go, you cot-quean_, etc. Several editors give this speech to Lady\\nCapulet; on the ground that the Nurse is not present, having been sent\\nfor spices. It has also been suggested that a servant would not venture\\nto be so impudent to her master; but, as we have seen, the Nurse is an\\nold and petted servant who is allowed a good deal of liberty. For the\\nsame reason she may not have gone for the spices at once, but may have\\nlingered, gossip-like, to hear what Capulet had to say. A _cot-quean_ is\\na man who meddles with female affairs; used by S. only here.\\n\\n11. _Mouse-hunt._ A woman-hunter. For _mouse_ as a term of endearment,\\nsee _Ham._ iii. 4. 183, _L. L. L._ v. 2. 19, and _T.N._ i. 5. 69.\\n\\n13. _Jealous-hood._ Jealousy; the abstract for the concrete; used by S.\\nonly here.\\n\\n16. _Drier logs._ For the kitchen; not a slip like that in i. 5. 30.\\n\\n21. _Logger-head._ Blockhead. Cf. _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 204: \"Ah, you whoreson\\nloggerhead!\" So _logger-headed_; as in _T. of S._ iv. 1. 128: \"You\\nlogger-headed and unpolish\\'d grooms!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSCENE V.--3. _Sweet-heart._ Accented on the last syllable; as regularly\\nin S. (cf. _Hen. VIII._ i. 4. 94, etc.) except in _W. T._ iv. 4. 664:\\n\"take your sweet-heart\\'s hat.\" Schmidt would print it as two words (as\\nis common in the old eds.) except in this latter passage.\\n\\n28. _Will not let me speak._ Malone remarks: \"S. has here followed the\\npoem closely, without recollecting that he had made Capulet, in this\\nscene, clamorous in his grief. In _Romeus and Juliet_, Juliet\\'s mother\\nmakes a long speech, but the old man utters not a word:--\\n\\n  \"\\'But more then all the rest the fathers hart was so\\n  Smit with the heauy newes, and so shut vp with sodain woe,\\n  That he ne had the powre his daughter to bewepe,\\n  Ne yet to speake, but long is forsd his teares and plaint to kepe.\\'\"\\n\\nThe poem may have suggested Capulet\\'s speech; but S. is not at fault in\\nmaking him afterwards find his tongue and become \"clamorous in his\\ngrief.\" That was perfectly natural.\\n\\n36. _Life, living._ There is no necessity for emendation, as some have\\nsupposed. _Living is_ = means of living, possessions; as in _M. of V._\\nv. 1. 286: \"you have given me life and living,\" etc.\\n\\n37. _Thought._ Expected, hoped; as in _Much Ado_, ii. 3. 236, etc.\\n\\n41. _Labour._ Referring to the toilsome progress of time, as in _T. of\\nA._ iii. 4. 8 (Delius).\\n\\n44. _Catch\\'d._ Also used for the participle in _L. L. L._ v. 2. 69 and\\n_A. W._ i. 3. 176; and for the past tense in _Cor._ i. 3. 68. Elsewhere\\nS. has _caught_.\\n\\n45. _O woe!_ White thinks that in \"this speech of mock heroic woe\" S.\\nridicules the translation of Seneca\\'s _Tragedies_ (1581); but it is in\\nkeeping with the character. Probably this and the next two speeches\\nbelong to the early draft of the play, with much that precedes and\\nfollows.\\n\\n52. _Detestable._ For the accent on the first syllable (as always in\\nS.), cf. _K. John_, iii. 4. 29, _T. of A._ iv. 1. 33, and v. 3. 45\\nbelow.\\n\\n55. _Despis\\'d, distressed_, etc. In this line, as in 51, note the\\nmixture of contracted and uncontracted participles.\\n\\n56. _Uncomfortable._ Cheerless, joyless; the one instance of the word in\\nS.\\n\\n60. _Buried._ A trisyllable here; as in v. 3. 176 below.\\n\\n61. _Confusion\\'s._ Here, the word is = ruin, death; but in the next line\\nit is = confused lamentations. Cf. _R. of L._ 445: \"fright her with\\nconfusion of their cries.\"\\n\\n66. _His._ Its. _Heaven_ is not personified here.\\n\\n67. _Promotion._ A quadrisyllable here.\\n\\n72. _Well._ Often thus used of the dead. Cf. _W.T._ v. 1. 30, 2 _Hen.\\nIV._ v. 2. 3, _Macb._ iv. 3. 179, _A. and C._ ii. 5. 33, etc. See also\\nv. 1. 17 below.\\n\\n75. _Rosemary._ That is, the rosemary that had been brought for the\\nwedding; for it was used at both weddings and funerals. Cf. Herrick,\\n_The Rosemarie Branch:_--\\n\\n  \"Grow for two ends, it matters not at all,\\n  Be \\'t for my bridall or my buriall;\"\\n\\nand Dekker, _Wonderful Year_: \"The rosemary that was washed in sweet\\nwater to set out the bridal, is now wet in tears to furnish her burial.\"\\nCf. ii. 4. 198 above.\\n\\n76. _As the custom is._ See on iv. 1. 110 above.\\n\\n78. _Fond._ Foolish (cf. iii. 3. 52 above), as opposed to _reason_.\\n\\n80. _All things_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Now is the parentes myrth quite chaunged into mone,\\n  And now to sorrow is retornde the ioy of euery one;\\n  And now the wedding weedes for mourning weedes they chaunge,\\n  And Hymene into a Dyrge; alas! it seemeth straunge:\\n  In steade of mariage gloues, now funerall gloues they haue,\\n  And whom they should see maried, they follow to the graue.\\n  The feast that should haue been of pleasure and of ioy\\n  Hath euery dish and cup fild full of sorow and annoye.\"\\n\\n95. _Case._ There is a play upon the other sense of the word (a case for\\na musical instrument); as in _W.T._ iv. 4. 844: \"but though my case be a\\npitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it\" (that is, out of my\\nskin).\\n\\n96. _Enter Peter._ From the quartos we learn that William Kempe played\\nthe part of Peter, as he did that of Dogberry in _Much Ado_.\\n\\nIn explanation of the introduction of this part of the scene, Knight\\nremarks: \"It was the custom of our ancient theatre to introduce, in the\\nirregular pauses of a play that stood in place of a division into acts,\\nsome short diversions, such as a song, a dance, or the extempore\\nbuffoonery of a clown. At this point of _R. and J._ there is a natural\\npause in the action, and at this point such an interlude would probably\\nhave been presented, whether S. had written one or not.... Will Kempe\\nwas the Liston of his day, and was as great a popular favourite as\\nTarleton had been before him. It was wise, therefore, in S. to find some\\nbusiness for Will Kempe that should not be entirely out of harmony with\\nthe great business of his play. The scene of the musicians is very\\nshort, and, regarded as a necessary part of the routine of the ancient\\nstage, is excellently managed. Nothing can be more naturally exhibited\\nthan the indifference of hirelings, without attachment, to a family\\nscene of grief. Peter and the musicians bandy jokes; and though the\\nmusicians think Peter a \\'pestilent knave,\\' perhaps for his inopportune\\nsallies, they are ready enough to look after their own gratification,\\neven amidst the sorrow which they see around them. A wedding or a burial\\nis the same to them. \\'Come, we\\'ll in here; tarry for the mourners, and\\nstay dinner.\\' So S. read the course of the world--and it is not much\\nchanged.\"\\n\\n\"To our minds,\" says Clarke, \"the intention was to show how grief and\\ngayety, pathos and absurdity, sorrow and jesting, elbow each other in\\nlife\\'s crowd; how the calamities of existence fall heavily upon the\\nsouls of some, while others, standing close beside the grievers, feel no\\njot of suffering or sympathy. Far from the want of harmony that has been\\nfound here, we feel it to be one of those passing discords that produce\\nrichest and fullest effect of harmonious contrivance.\"\\n\\nFurness states that in Edwin Booth\\'s acting copy this scene of Peter and\\nthe musicians is transposed to i. 5. 17 above.\\n\\n99. _Heart\\'s ease._ A popular tune of the time, mentioned in\\n_Misogonus_, a play by Thomas Rychardes, written before 1570.\\n\\n101. _My heart is full of woe._ The burden of the first stanza of _A\\nPleasant new Ballad of Two Lovers_: \"Hey hoe! my heart is full of woe\"\\n(Steevens).\\n\\n102. _Dump._ A mournful or plaintive song or melody. Calling it _merry_\\nis a joke of Peter\\'s. Cf. _T.G. of V._ iii. 2. 85: \"A deploring dump.\"\\nSee also _R. of L._ 1127.\\n\\n109. _Gleek._ Scoff. Cf. 1 _Hen. VI._ iii. 2. 123: \"Now where\\'s the\\nBastard\\'s braves, and Charles his gleeks?\" _To give the gleek_ was \"to\\npass a jest upon, to make a person ridiculous.\" It is impossible to say\\nwhat is the joke in _give you the minstrel_. Some suppose that _gleek_\\nsuggests _gleeman_, one form of which in Anglo-Saxon was _gligman_, but\\nno such form is found in English, if we may trust the _New Eng. Dict._\\nThe reply of the musician may perhaps mean \"that he will retort by\\ncalling Peter the servant to the minstrel\" (White).\\n\\n114. _I will carry no crotchets._ I will bear none of your whims; with a\\nplay on _crotchets_, as in _Much Ado_, ii. 3. 58. Cf. _carry coals_ in\\ni. 1. 1 above. The play on _note_ is obvious.\\n\\n120. _Drybeat._ See on iii. 1. 81 above. For _have at you_, cf. i. 1. 64\\nabove.\\n\\n122. _When griping grief_, etc. From a poem by Richard Edwards, in the\\n_Paradise of Daintie Devises_. See also Percy\\'s _Reliques_.\\n\\n126. _Catling._ A small string of _catgut_. Cf. _T. and C._ iii. 3. 306:\\n\"unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.\"\\n\\n132. _Pretty._ Some of the German critics are troubled by _pretty_,\\nbecause Peter does not intend to praise; and irony, they say, would be\\nout of place. It is simply a jocose patronizing expression = That\\'s not\\nbad in its way, but you haven\\'t hit it. The _rebeck_ was a kind of\\nthree-stringed fiddle. Cf. Milton, _L\\'All._ 94: \"And the jocund rebecks\\nsound,\" etc.\\n\\n141. _Pestilent._ Often used in an opprobrious sense; as in _Lear_, i.\\n4. 127: \"A pestilent gall to me!\" _Oth._ ii. 1. 252: \"A pestilent\\ncomplete knave,\" etc.\\n\\n142. _Jack._ See on iii. 1. 12 above; and for _stay_ = wait for, on ii.\\n5. 36.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT V\\n\\n\\nSCENE. I.--1. _The flattering truth._ This is apparently = that which\\nbears the flattering semblance of truth. It has perplexed some of the\\ncritics, but their emendations do not better it. For _flattering_ in the\\nsense of illusive, cf. ii. 2. 141. Some have wondered that S. here makes\\nthe presentiment a hopeful one; but as a writer in the _Cornhill\\nMagazine_ (October, 1866) remarks, the presentiment was true, but Romeo\\ndid not trust it. Had he done so, his fate would not have been so\\ntragic.\\n\\n3. _My bosom\\'s lord._ That is, my heart; not Love, or Cupid, as some\\nwould make it. Lines 3-5 seem to me only a highly poetical description\\nof the strange new cheerfulness and hopefulness he feels--a reaction\\nfrom his former depression which is like his dream of rising from the\\ndead an emperor.\\n\\n10. _Ah me!_ See on _Ay me!_ ii. 1. 10 above. It may be a misprint for\\n\"Ay me!\" here.\\n\\n12. _Balthasar._ Always accented by S. on the first syllable. The name\\noccurs in _C. of E._, _Much Ado_, and _M. of V._\\n\\n17. _She is well._ See on iv. 5. 72 above.\\n\\n18. _Capel\\'s._ The early eds. have \"_Capels_\"; the modern ones generally\\n\"Capels\\'.\" The singular seems better here, on account of the omission of\\nthe article; but the plural in v. 3. 127: \"the Capels\\' monument.\" S.\\nuses this abbreviation only twice. Brooke uses _Capel_ and _Capulet_\\nindiscriminately. See quotation in note on i. 1. 28 above.\\n\\n21. _Presently._ Immediately; the usual meaning in S. Cf. iv. 1. 54 and\\n95 above.\\n\\n27. _Patience._ A trisyllable, as in v. 3. 221 and 261 below.\\n\\n29. _Misadventure._ Mischance, misfortune; used by S. only here and in\\nv. 3. 188 below. _Misadventured_ occurs only in prol. 7 above.\\n\\n36. _In._ Into; as often. Cf. v. 3. 34 below.\\n\\n37. _I do remember_, etc. Joseph Warton objects to the detailed\\ndescription here as \"improperly put into the mouth of a person agitated\\nwith such passion.\" \"But,\" as Knight remarks, \"the mind once made up, it\\ntook a perverse pleasure in going over every circumstance that had\\nsuggested the means of mischief. All other thoughts had passed out of\\nRomeo\\'s mind. He had nothing left but to die; and everything connected\\nwith the means of death was seized upon by his imagination with an\\nenergy that could only find relief in words. S. has exhibited the same\\nknowledge of nature in his sad and solemn poem of _R. of L._, where the\\ninjured wife, having resolved to wipe out her stain by death,\\n\\n        \"\\'calls to mind where hangs a piece\\n  Of skilful painting, made for Priam\\'s Troy.\\'\\n\\nShe sees in that painting some fancied resemblance to her own position,\\nand spends the heavy hours till her husband arrives in its\\ncontemplation.\" See _R. of L._ 1366 fol. and 1496 fol.\\n\\n39. _Overwhelming._ Overhanging. Cf. _V. and A._ 183: \"His lowering\\nbrows o\\'erwhelming his fair sight.\" See also _Hen. V._ iii. 1. 11. For\\n_weeds_ = garments, see _M.N.D._ ii. 2. 71, etc.\\n\\n40. _Simples._ Medicinal herbs. Cf. _R. of L._ 530, _Ham._ iv. 7. 145,\\netc.\\n\\n43. _An alligator stuff\\'d._ This was a regular part of the furniture of\\nan apothecary\\'s shop in the time of S. Nash, in his _Have With You_,\\netc., 1596, refers to \"an apothecary\\'s crocodile or dried alligator.\"\\nSteevens says that he has met with the alligator, tortoise, etc.,\\nhanging up in the shop of an ancient apothecary at Limehouse, as well as\\nin places more remote from the metropolis. In Dutch art, as Fairholt\\nremarks, these marine monsters often appear in representations of\\napothecaries\\' shops.\\n\\n45. _A beggarly account_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"And seeking long (alac too soone) the thing he sought, he founde.\\n  An Apothecary sate vnbusied at his doore,\\n  Whom by his heauy countenaunce he gessed to be poore.\\n  And in his shop he saw his boxes were but fewe,\\n  And in his window (of his wares) there was so small a shew,\\n  Wherfore our Romeus assuredly hath thought,\\n  What by no frendship could be got, with money should be bought;\\n  For nedy lacke is lyke the poore man to compell\\n  To sell that which the cities lawe forbiddeth him to sell.\\n  Then by the hand he drew the nedy man apart,\\n  And with the sight of glittring gold inflamed hath his hart:\\n  Take fiftie crownes of gold (quoth he) I geue them thee.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  Fayre syr (quoth he) be sure this is the speeding gere,\\n  And more there is then you shall nede for halfe of that is there\\n  Will serue, I vnder take, in lesse than halfe an howre\\n  To kill the strongest man aliue; such is the poysons power.\"\\n\\n51. _Present._ Immediate; as in iv. 1. 61 above. Cf. _presently_ in 21\\nabove. Secret poisoning became so common in Europe in the 16th century\\nthat laws against the sale of poisons were made in Spain, Portugal,\\nItaly, and other countries. Knight says: \"There is no such law in our\\nown statute-book; and the circumstance is a remarkable exemplification\\nof the difference between English and Continental manners.\" But that\\nthis practice of poisoning prevailed to a considerable extent in England\\nin the olden time is evident from the fact that in the 21st year of the\\nreign of Henry VIII. an act was passed declaring the employment of\\nsecret poisons to be high-treason, and sentencing those who were found\\nguilty of it to be boiled to death.\\n\\n60. _Soon-speeding gear._ Quick-despatching stuff. Cf. the extract from\\nBrooke just above. For _gear_, see ii. 4. 97 above.\\n\\n64. _As violently_, etc. See on ii. 6. 9 above.\\n\\n67. _Any he._ Cf. _A.Y.L._ iii. 2. 414: \"that unfortunate he;\" 3 _Hen.\\nVI._ i. 1. 46: \"The proudest he;\" _Id._ ii. 2. 97: \"Or any he the\\nproudest of thy sort,\" etc. _Utters them_ = literally, sends them _out_,\\nor lets them go from his possession; hence, sells them. Cf. _L. L. L._ ii.\\n1. 16 and _W.T._ iv. 4. 330.\\n\\n70. _Starveth._ That is, look out hungrily; a bold but not\\nun-Shakespearian expression, for which Otway\\'s \"stareth\" (adopted by\\nsome editors) is a poor substitution. See on i. 1. 216 above; and for\\nthe inflection, on prol. 8.\\n\\n\\nSCENE II.--4. _A barefoot brother._ Friars Laurence and John are\\nevidently Franciscans. \"In his kindness, his learning, and his\\ninclination to mix with and, perhaps, control the affairs of the world,\\nhe [Laurence] is no unapt representative of this distinguished order in\\ntheir best days\" (Knight). Warton says that the Franciscans \"managed the\\nmachines of every important operation and event, both in the religious\\nand political world.\"\\n\\nCf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Apace our frier Iohn to Mantua him hyes;\\n  And, for because in Italy it is a wonted gyse\\n  That friers in the towne should seeldome walke alone,\\n  But of theyr couent ay should be accompanide with one\\n  Of his profession, straight a house he fyndeth out,\\n  In mynde to take some frier with him, to walke the towne about.\"\\n\\nEach friar has a companion assigned him by the superior when he asks\\nleave to go out; and thus they are a check upon each other (Steevens).\\n\\n6. _Associate me._ Accompany me. For the transitive use, cf. _T.A._ v.\\n3. 169: \"Friends should associate friends in grief and woe.\"\\n\\n9. _A house._ According to both the poem and the novel, this was the\\nconvent to which the \"barefoot brother\" belonged.\\n\\n16. _Infection._ A quadrisyllable. Cf, iv. 1. 41 above.\\n\\n18. _Nice._ Trifling, unimportant. See on iii. 1. 157 above. For\\n_charge_, cf. _W.T._ iv. 4. 261: \"I have about me many parcels of\\ncharge.\"\\n\\n19. _Dear._ Cf. v. 3. 32 below: \"dear employment.\"\\n\\n20. _Do much danger._ See on iii. 3. 118 above.\\n\\n25. _This three hours._ The singular _this_ is often thus used; but cf.\\niv. 3. 40 above: \"these many hundred years;\" and v. 3. 176 below: \"these\\ntwo days.\"\\n\\n26. _Beshrew._ See on ii. 5. 52 above.\\n\\n\\nSCENE III.--_A Churchyard_, etc. Hunter says: \"It is clear that S., or\\nsome writer whom he followed, had in mind the churchyard of Saint Mary\\nthe Old in Verona, and the monument of the Scaligers which stood in it.\"\\nSee the cut on p. 136, and cf. Brooke, who refers to the Italian custom\\nof building large family tombs:--\\n\\n  \"For euery houshold, if it be of any fame;\\n  Doth bylde a tombe, or digge a vault, that beares the housholdes name:\\n  Wherein (if any of that kindred hap to dye)\\n  They are bestowde; els in the same no other corps may lye.\\n  The Capilets her corps in such a one dyd lay\\n  Where Tybalt slaine of Romeus was layde the other day.\"\\n\\nAt the close of the poem we are told that--\\n\\n  \"The bodies dead, remoued from vaulte where they did dye,\\n  In stately tombe, on pillers great of marble, rayse they hye.\\n  On euery syde aboue were set, and eke beneath,\\n  Great store of cunning Epitaphes, in honor of theyr death.\\n  And euen at this day the tombe is to be seene;\\n  So that among the monumentes that in Verona been,\\n  There is no monument more worthy of the sight,\\n  Then is the tombe of Iuliet and Romeus her knight.\"\\n\\nSee also the quotation in note on iv. 1. 93 above. Brooke\\'s reference to\\nthe \"stately tombe, on pillers great,\" etc., was doubtless suggested by\\nthe Tomb of the Scaligers.\\n\\n3. _Lay thee all along._ That is, at full length. Cf. _A.Y.L._ ii. 1.\\n30: \"As he lay along Under an oak;\" _J.C._ iii. 1. 115: \"That now on\\nPompey\\'s basis lies along,\" etc.\\n\\n6. _Unfirm._ Cf. _J.C._ i. 3. 4, _T.N._ ii. 4. 34, etc. S. also uses\\n_infirm_, as in _Macb._ ii. 2. 52, etc.\\n\\n8. _Something._ The accent is on the last syllable, as Walker notes; and\\nMarshall prints \"some thing,\" as in the folio.\\n\\n11. _Adventure._ Cf. ii. 2. 84 above.\\n\\n14. _Sweet water._ Perfumed water. Cf. _T.A._ ii. 4. 6: \"call for sweet\\nwater;\" and see quotation in note on iv. 5. 75 above.\\n\\n20. _Cross._ Thwart, interfere with. Cf. iv. 5. 91 above.\\n\\n21. _Muffle._ Cover, hide. Cf. i. 1. 168 above; and see _J.C._ iii. 2.\\n191, etc. Steevens intimates that it was \"a low word\" in his day; but,\\nif so, it has since regained its poetical character. Tennyson uses it\\nrepeatedly; as in _The Talking Oak_: \"O, muffle round thy knees with\\nfern;\" _The Princess_: \"A full sea glazed with muffled moonlight;\" _In\\nMemoriam_: \"muffled round with woe,\" etc. Milton has _unmuffle_ in\\n_Comus_, 321: \"Unmuffle, ye faint stars.\"\\n\\n32. _Dear._ See on v. 2. 19 above.\\n\\n33. _Jealous._ Suspicious; as in _Lear_, v. 1. 56, _J.C._ i. 2. 71, etc.\\n\\n34. _In._ Into. See on v. 1. 36 above.\\n\\n37. _Savage-wild._ Cf. ii. 2. 141 above.\\n\\n39. _Empty._ Hungry. Cf. _V. and A._ 55: \"Even as an empty eagle, sharp\\nby fast\" (see also 2 _Hen. VI._ iii. 1. 248 and 3 _Hen. VI._ i. 1. 268);\\nand _T. of S._ iv. 1. 193: \"My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.\"\\n\\n44. _Doubt._ Distrust; as in _J.C._ ii. 1. 132, iv. 2. 13, etc.\\n\\n45. _Detestable._ See on iv. 5. 52 above.\\n\\n47. _Enforce._ Force; as often. Cf. _Temp._ v. 1. 100: \"Enforce them to\\nthis place,\" etc.\\n\\n50. _With._ Often used to express the relation of cause.\\n\\n59. _Good gentle youth_, etc. \"The gentleness of Romeo was shown before\\n[iii. 1. 64 fol.] as softened by love, and now it is doubled by love and\\nsorrow, and awe of the place where he is\" (Coleridge).\\n\\n68. _Conjurations._ Solemn entreaties; as in _Rich. II._ iii. 2. 23,\\n_Ham._ v. 2. 38, etc. Some have taken it to mean incantations. _Defy_ =\\nrefuse; as in _K. John_, iii. 4. 23: \"I defy all counsel,\" etc.\\n\\n74. _Peruse._ Scan, examine. Cf. _Ham._ iv. 7. 137: \"peruse the foils,\"\\netc.\\n\\n76. _Betossed._ Agitated; used by S. nowhere else.\\n\\n82. _Sour._ See on iii. 3. 7 above.\\n\\n84. _Lantern._ Used in the architectural sense of \"a turret full of\\nwindows\" (Steevens). Cf. Parker, _Glossary of Architecture_: \"In Gothic\\narchitecture the term is sometimes applied to _louvres_ on the roofs of\\nhalls, etc., but it usually signifies a tower which has the whole\\nheight, or a considerable portion of the interior, open to the ground,\\nand is lighted by an upper tier of windows; lantern-towers of this kind\\nare common over the centre of cross churches, as at York Minster, Ely\\nCathedral, etc. The same name is also given to the light open erections\\noften placed on the top of towers, as at Boston, Lincolnshire,\" etc. The\\none at Boston was used as a lighthouse _lantern_ in the olden time.\\n\\n86. _Presence._ Presence-chamber, state apartment; as in _Rich. II._ i.\\n3. 289 and _Hen. VIII._ iii. 1. 17.\\n\\n87. _Death._ The abstract for the concrete. The _dead man_ is Romeo, who\\nis so possessed with his suicidal purpose that he speaks of himself as\\ndead. Steevens perversely calls it one of \"those miserable conceits with\\nwhich our author too frequently counteracts his own pathos.\"\\n\\n88-120. _How oft when men_, etc. \"Here, here, is the master example how\\nbeauty can at once increase and modify passion\" (Coleridge).\\n\\n90. _A lightning before death._ \"A last blazing-up of the flame of\\nlife;\" a proverbial expression. Steevens quotes _The Downfall of Robert\\nEarl of Huntington_, 1601:--\\n\\n  \"I thought it was a lightning before death,\\n  Too sudden to be certain.\"\\n\\nClarke notes \"the mingling here of words and images full of light and\\ncolour with the murky grey of the sepulchral vault and the darkness of\\nthe midnight churchyard, the blending of these images of beauty and\\ntenderness with the deep gloom of the speaker\\'s inmost heart.\"\\n\\n92. _Suck\\'d the honey_, etc. Cf. _Ham._ iii. 1. 164: \"That suck\\'d the\\nhoney of his music vows.\" Steevens quotes Sidney, _Arcadia_: \"Death\\nbeing able to divide the soule, but not the beauty from her body.\"\\n\\n96. _Death\\'s pale flag._ Steevens compares Daniel, _Complaint of\\nRosamond_:--\\n\\n  \"And nought-respecting death (the last of paines)\\n  Plac\\'d his pale colours (th\\' ensign of his might)\\n  Upon his new-got spoil.\"\\n\\n97. _Tybalt_, etc. Cf. Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"Ah cosin dere, Tybalt, where so thy restles sprite now be,\\n  With stretched handes to thee for mercy now I crye,\\n  For that before thy kindly howre I forced thee to dye.\\n  But if with quenched lyfe not quenched be thine yre,\\n  But with revengeing lust as yet thy hart be set on fyre,\\n  What more amendes, or cruell wreke desyrest thou\\n  To see on me, then this which here is shewd forth to thee now?\\n  Who reft by force of armies from thee thy living breath,\\n  The same with his owne hand (thou seest) doth poyson himselfe to death.\"\\n\\n106. _Still._ Constantly, always; as very often. Cf. 270 below.\\n\\n110. _Set up my everlasting rest._ That is, remain forever. To _set up\\none\\'s rest_ was a phrase taken from gaming, the _rest_ being the highest\\nstake the parties were disposed to venture; hence it came to mean to\\nhave fully made up one\\'s mind, to be resolved. Here the form of\\nexpression seems to be suggested by the gaming phrase rather than to be\\na figurative example of it.\\n\\n112-118. _Eyes ... bark._ Whiter points out a coincidence between this\\nlast speech of Romeo\\'s and a former one (i. 4. 103 fol.) in which he\\nanticipates his misfortunes. \"The ideas drawn from the _stars_, the\\n_law_, and the _sea_ succeed each other in both speeches, in the same\\norder, though with a different application.\"\\n\\n115. _Dateless._ Limitless, eternal. Cf. _Sonn._ 30. 6: \"death\\'s\\ndateless night;\" _Rich. III._ i. 3. 151: \"The dateless limit of thy dear\\nexile,\" etc.\\n\\n_Engrossing._ Malone says that the word \"seems here to be used in its\\nclerical sense.\" There seems to be at least a hint of that sense,\\nsuggested by _seal_ and _bargain_; but the leading meaning is that of\\nall-seizing, or \"taking the whole,\" as Schmidt explains it.\\n\\n116. _Conduct._ See on iii. 1. 127 above. For _unsavoury_, cf. _V. and\\nA._ 1138: \"sweet beginning, but unsavoury end.\" Schmidt, who rarely\\nmakes such a slip, treats both of these examples as literal rather than\\nmetaphorical. The only example of the former sense in S. (not really\\nhis) is _Per._ ii. 3. 31: \"All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.\"\\n\\n118. _Thy._ Pope substituted \"my,\" but _thy_ may be defended on the\\nnautical principle that the pilot is the master of the ship after he\\ntakes her in charge. That seems to be Romeo\\'s thought here; he gives up\\nthe helm to the \"desperate pilot,\" and says, \"The ship is yours, run her\\nupon the rocks if you will.\"\\n\\n121. _Be my speed._ Cf. _Hen. V._ v. 2. 194: \"Saint Denis be my speed!\"\\n_A.Y.L._ i. 2. 222: \"Hercules be thy speed!\" etc.\\n\\n122. _Stumbled at graves._ The idea that to stumble is a bad omen is\\nvery ancient. Cicero mentions it in his _De Divinatione_. Melton, in his\\n_Astrologaster_, 1620, says that \"if a man stumbles in a morning as soon\\nas he comes out of dores, it is a signe of ill lucke.\" Bishop Hall, in\\nhis _Characters_, says of the \"Superstitious Man\" that \"if he stumbled\\nat the threshold, he feares a mischief.\" Stumbling at graves is alluded\\nto in _Whimzies, or a New Cast of Characters_, 1631: \"His\\nearth-reverting body (according to his mind) is to be buried in some\\ncell, roach, or vault, and in no open space, lest passengers (belike)\\nmight stumble on his grave.\" Steevens cites 3 _Hen. VI._ iv. 7. 11 and\\n_Rich. III._ iii. 4. 86.\\n\\n127. _Capels\\'._ See on v. 1. 18 above.\\n\\n138. _I dreamt_, etc. Steevens considers this a touch or nature: \"What\\nhappens to a person under the manifest influence of fear will seem to\\nhim, when he is recovered from it, like a dream.\" It seems to me more\\nlikely that the man confuses what he saw while half asleep with what he\\nmight have dreamt.\\n\\n145. _Unkind._ Usually accented on the first syllable before a noun, but\\notherwise on the second. This often occurs with dis-syllabic adjectives\\nand participles. _Unkind_ and its derivatives are often used by S. in a\\nmuch stronger sense than at present. In some cases, the etymological\\nsense of _unnatural_ (cf. _kind_ and _kindly_ = natural) seems to cling\\nto them. Cf. _J.C._ iii. 2. 187, _Lear_, i. 1. 263, iii. 4. 73, etc.\\n\\n148. _Comfortable._ Used in an active sense = ready to comfort or help;\\nas in _A.W._ i. 1. 86, _Lear_, i. 4. 328, etc.\\n\\n158. _The watch._ It has been asserted by some of the critics that there\\nwas no watch in the old Italian cities; but, however that may have been,\\nS. follows Brooke\\'s poem:--\\n\\n  \"The watchemen of the towne the whilst are passed by,\\n  And through the gates the candel light within the tombe they spye.\"\\n\\n162. _Timeless._ Untimely. Cf. _T.G. of V._ iii. 1. 21: \"your timeless\\ngrave;\" _Rich. II._ iv. 1. 5: \"his timeless end,\" etc.\\n\\n163. _Drunk all, and left._ The reading of 2nd quarto. The 1st has\\n\"drink ... leave,\" and the folio \"drink ... left.\"\\n\\n170. _There rest._ From 1st quarto; the other early eds. have \"rust,\"\\nwhich some editors prefer. To me _rest_ seems both more poetical and\\nmore natural. That at this time Juliet should think of \"Romeo\\'s dagger,\\nwhich would otherwise rust in its sheath, as rusting in her heart,\" is\\nquite inconceivable. It is a \"conceit\" of the worst Elizabethan type.\\n\\nThe tragedy here ends in Booth\\'s Acting Copy (Furness).\\n\\n173. _Attach._ Arrest; as in _C. of E._ iv. 1. 6, 73, iv. 4. 6, _Rich.\\nII._ ii. 3. 156, _Hen. VIII._ i. 1. 217, i. 2. 210, etc.\\n\\n176. _These two days._ See on iv. 1. 105 above.\\n\\n181. _Without circumstance._ Without further particulars. Cf. ii. 5. 36\\nabove.\\n\\n203. _His house._ Its sheath. See on ii, 6. 12 above.\\n\\n204. _On the back._ The dagger was commonly turned behind and worn at\\nthe back, as Steevens shows by sundry quotations.\\n\\n207. _Old age._ A slip which, strangely enough, no editor or\\ncommentator has noticed. Furness notes no reference to it, and I find\\nnone in more recent editions. See on i. 3. 51 above.\\n\\n211. _Grief of my son\\'s exile._ Cf. _Much Ado_, iv. 2. 65: \"and upon the\\ngrief of this suddenly died.\" For the accent of _exile_, cf. iii. 1. 190\\nand iii. 3. 20 above.\\n\\nAfter this line the 1st quarto has the following: \"And yong _Benuolio_\\nis deceased too;\" but, as Ulrici remarks, \"the pacific, considerate\\nBenvolio, the constant counseller of moderation, ought not to be\\ninvolved in the fate which had overtaken the extremes of hate and\\npassion.\"\\n\\n214. _Manners._ S. makes the word either singular or plural, like\\n_news_, _tidings_ (see on iii. 5. 105 above), etc. Cf. _A.W._ ii. 2. 9,\\n_W.T._ iv. 4. 244, etc. with _T.N._ iv. 1. 53, _Rich. III._ iii. 7. 191,\\netc.\\n\\n216. _Outrage._ Cf. 1 _Hen. VI._ iv. 1. 126:--\\n\\n                \"Are you not asham\\'d\\n  With this immodest clamorous outrage\\n  To trouble and disturb the king and us?\"\\n\\nThere, as here, it means a mad outcry. Dyce quotes Settle, _Female\\nPrelate_: \"Silence his outrage in a jayl, away with him!\"\\n\\n221. _Patience._ A trisyllable. See on v. 1. 27 above.

He died that same year (1563), and\\nan _Epitaph_ by George Turbervile (printed in a volume of his poems,\\n1567) \"on the death of maister Arthur Brooke\" informs us that he was\\n\"drowned in passing to Newhaven.\"\\n\\nSo far as I am aware, no editor or commentator has referred to the\\nsingular prose introduction to the 1562 edition of _Romeus and Juliet_.\\nIt is clear from internal evidence that it was written by Brooke, and it\\nis signed \"Ar. Br.\"--the form in which his name also appears on the\\ntitle-page; but its tone and spirit are strangely unlike those of the\\npoem. We have seen (p. 25 above) that he refers to the perpetuation of\\n\"the memory of so perfect, sound, and so approved love\" by the \"stately\\ntomb\" of Romeo and Juliet, with \"great store of cunning epitaphs in\\nhonour of their death;\" but in the introduction he expresses a very\\ndifferent opinion of the lovers and finds a very different lesson in\\ntheir fate. He says: \"To this end (good Reader) is this tragical matter\\nwritten, to describe unto thee a couple of unfortunate lovers, thralling\\nthemselves to unhonest desire, neglecting the authority and advice of\\nparents and friends, conferring their principal counsels with drunken\\ngossips and superstitious friars (the naturally fit instruments of\\nunchastity), attempting all adventures of peril for the attaining of\\ntheir wicked lusts, using auricular confession (the key of whoredom and\\ntreason) for furtherance of their purpose, abusing the honourable name\\nof lawful marriage to cloak the shame of stolen contracts; finally, by\\nall means of unhonest life, hasting to most unhappy death.\" The\\nsuggestion is added that parents may do well to show the poem to their\\nchildren with \"the intent to raise in them an hateful loathing of so\\nfilthy beastliness.\"\\n\\nIt is curious that there is not the slightest hint of all this anywhere\\nin the poem; not a suggestion that the love of Romeo and Juliet is not\\nnatural and pure and honest; not a word of reproach for the course of\\nFriar Laurence. Even the picture of the Nurse, with her vulgarity and\\nunscrupulousness, is drawn with a kind of humour.\\n\\nI have quoted above (note on ii. 2. 142) what Brooke makes Juliet say to\\nher lover in the balcony scene. In their first interview, she says:--\\n\\n  \"You are no more your owne (deare frend) then I am yours\\n  (My honor saved) prest tobay [to obey] your will while life endures.\\n  Lo here the lucky lot that sild [seldom] true lovers finde:\\n  Eche takes away the others hart, and leaves the owne behinde.\\n  A happy life is love if God graunt from above\\n  That hart with hart by even waight doo make exchaunge of love.\"\\n\\nAnd Romeo has just said:--\\n\\n  \"For I of God woulde crave, as pryse of paynes forpast,\\n  To serve, obey, and honor you so long as lyfe shall last.\"\\n\\nOf the Friar the poet says:--\\n\\n\"This barefoote fryer gyrt with cord his grayish weede, For he of\\nFrauncis order was, a fryer as I reede. Not as the most was he, a grosse\\nunlearned foole: But doctor of divinitie proceeded he in schoole.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  The bounty of the fryer and wisdom hath so woune\\n  The townes folks harts that welnigh all to fryer Lawrence ronne.\\n  To shrive them selfe the olde, the yong, the great and small:\\n  Of all he is beloved well and honord much of all.\\n  And for he did the rest in wisdome farre exceede\\n  The prince by him (his counsell cravde) was holpe at time of neede.\\n  Betwixt the Capilets and him great frendship grew:\\n  A secret and assured frend unto the Montegue.\"\\n\\nAt the end of the tragic story the poet asks:--\\n\\n  \"But now what shall betyde of this gray-bearded syre?\\n  Of fryer Lawrence thus araynde, that good barefooted fryre?\\n  Because that many times he woorthely did serve\\n  The commen welth, and in his lyfe was never found to swerve,\\n  He was discharged quyte, and no marke of defame\\n  Did seeme to blot or touch at all the honor of his name.\\n  But of him selfe he went into an Hermitage,\\n  Two myles from Veron towne, where he in prayers past forth his age;\\n  Till that from earth to heaven his heavenly sprite dyd flye:\\n  Fyve yeres he lived an Hermite, and an Hermite dyd he dye.\"\\n\\nThe puzzling prose preface to the poem is followed, in the original\\nedition, by another in verse, similarly headed \"To the Reader,\" from\\nwhich we learn that Brooke had written other poems, which with this he\\ncompares to unlicked whelps--\"nought els but lumpes of fleshe withouten\\nheare\" (hair)--but _this_ poem, he says, is \"the eldest of them\" and his\\n\"youthfull woorke.\" He has decided to publish it, but \"The rest (unlickt\\nas yet) a whyle shall lurke\" (that is, in manuscript)--\\n\\n  \"Till tyme give strength to meete and match in fight\\n  With slaunders whelpes.\"\\n\\nI suspect that after this poem was written he had become a Puritan,--or\\nmore rigid in his Puritanism,--but nevertheless lusted after literary\\nfame and could not resist the temptation to publish the \"youthfull\\nwoorke.\" But after writing the verse prologue it occurred to him--or\\nsome of his godly friends may have admonished him--that the character of\\nthe story and the manner in which he had treated it, needed further\\napology or justification; and the prose preface was written to serve as\\na kind of \"moral\" to the production. After the suggestion to parents\\nquoted above he adds: \"Hereunto if you applye it, ye shall _deliver my\\ndooing from offence_, and profit your selves. Though I saw the same\\nargument lately set foorth on stage with more commendation then I can\\nlooke for (being there much better set forth then I have or can dooe)\\nyet the same matter penned as it is, may serve to lyke good effect, if\\nthe readers do brynge with them lyke good myndes, to consider it, which\\nhath the more incouraged me to publishe it, such as it is.\"\\n\\nThe reader may be surprised that Brooke refers to having seen the story\\n\"on stage;\" but the Puritans did not altogether disapprove of plays that\\nhad a moral purpose. It will be remembered that Stephen Gosson, in his\\n_Schoole of Abuse_ (1579), excepts a few plays from the sweeping\\ncondemnation of his \"plesaunt invective against Poets, Pipers, Plaiers,\\nJesters, and such like caterpillers of a Commonwelth\"--among them being\\n\"_The Jew_,... representing the greedinesse of worldly chusers, and the\\nbloody minds of usurers,\" which may have anticipated Shakespeare in\\ncombining the stories of the caskets and the pound of flesh in _The\\nMerchant of Venice_.\\n\\nThat Brooke was a Puritan we may infer from the religious character of\\nthe only other book (mentioned above) which he is known to have\\npublished. His death the same year probably prevented his carrying out\\nthe intention of licking the rest of his poetical progeny into shape for\\nprint.\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS ON SOME OF THE CHARACTERS\\n\\nJULIET.--Juliet is not fortunate in her parents. Her father is sixty or\\nmore years old (as we may infer from what he says in i. 5. 29 fol.),\\nwhile her mother is about twenty-eight (see i. 3. 50), and must have\\nbeen married when she was half that age. Her assertion that Juliet was\\nborn when she herself was \"much upon these years\" of her daughter (who\\nwill be fourteen in about a fortnight, as the Nurse informs us in the\\nsame scene) is somewhat indefinite, but must be within a year or two of\\nthe exact figure. Her marriage was evidently a worldly one, arranged by\\nher parents with little or no regard for her own feelings, much as she\\nand her husband propose to marry Juliet to Paris.\\n\\nWe may infer that Capulet had not been married before, though, as he\\nhimself intimates and the lady declares (iv. 4. 11 fol.), he had been a\\n\"mouse-hunt\" (given to flirtation and intrigue) in his bachelor days;\\nand she thinks that he needs \"watching\" even now, lest he give her\\noccasion for jealousy.\\n\\nNeither father nor mother seems to have any marked affection for Juliet,\\nor any interest in her welfare except to get her off their hands by\\nwhat, from their point of view, is a desirable marriage. Capulet says\\n(iii. 5. 175):--\\n\\n  \"God\\'s bread! it makes me mad! Day, night, late, early,\\n  At home, abroad, alone, in company,\\n  Waking, or sleeping, still my care hath been\\n  To have her match\\'d; and having now provided\\n  A gentleman of noble parentage,\\n  Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train\\'d,\\n  Stuff\\'d, as they say, with honourable parts,\\n  Proportion\\'d as one\\'s thought would wish a man,--\\n  And then to have a wretched puling fool,\\n  A whining mammet, in her fortune\\'s tender,\\n  To answer \\'I\\'ll not wed; I cannot love,\\n  I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.\\'\"\\n\\nIt is more than he can endure; and his wife, when Juliet begs her to\\ninterpose and \"delay the marriage for a month, a week,\" refuses to\\n\"speak a word\" in opposition to his determination to let her \"die in the\\nstreets\" if she does not marry Paris that very week. \"Do as thou wilt,\\nfor I have done with thee,\" the Lady adds, and leaves the hapless girl\\nto her despair. A moment before she had said, \"I would the fool were\\nmarried to her grave!\"\\n\\nEarlier in the play (i. 2. 16) Capulet has said to Paris:--\\n\\n  \"But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\\n  My will to her consent is but a part;\\n  An she agree, within her scope of choice,\\n  Lies my consent and fair according voice;\"--\\n\\nbut from the context we see that this is merely a plausible excuse for\\nnot giving the count a definite answer just then. The girl, he says, is\\n\"yet a stranger in the world\" (has not yet \"come out,\" in modern\\nparlance), and it is best to wait a year or two:--\\n\\n  \"Let two more summers wither in their pride\\n  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\"\\n\\nHe sees no reason for haste; but later, influenced by the noble wooer\\'s\\nimportunities and the persuasions of his wife, who has favoured an early\\nmarriage from the first (i. 3), he takes a different tone (iii. 4.\\n12):--\\n\\n  \"_Capulet._ Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\\n  Of my child\\'s love. I think she will be rul\\'d\\n  In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.--\\n  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\\n  Acquaint her here of my son Paris\\' love,\\n  And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--\\n  But, soft! what day is this?\\n\\n  _Paris._                     Monday, my lord.\\n\\n  _Capulet._ Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\\n  O\\' Thursday let it be; o\\' Thursday, tell her,\\n  She shall be married to this noble earl.\"\\n\\n\"She _shall_ be married,\" and the day is fixed. Already he calls Paris\\n\"my son.\" No question now of delay, and getting her \"consent\" as a\\ncondition of securing his own!\\n\\nAt the supposed sudden death of their daughter the parents naturally\\nfeel some genuine grief; but their conventional wailing (iv. 5) belongs\\nto the earlier version of the play, and it is significant that\\nShakespeare let it stand when revising his work some years afterwards.\\nAs Tieck remarks, it \"had not the true tragic ring\"--and why should it?\\n\\nMost of the critics have assumed that Shakespeare makes Juliet only\\nfourteen, because of her Italian birth; but in the original Italian\\nversions of the story she is eighteen, and Brooke makes her sixteen. All\\nof Shakespeare\\'s other youthful heroines whose ages are definitely\\nstated or indicated are very young. Miranda, in _The Tempest_, is barely\\nfifteen, as she has been \"twelve year\" on the enchanted island and was\\n\"not out [full] three years old\" when her father was driven from Milan.\\nMarina, in _Pericles_, is only fifteen at the end of the play; and\\nPerdita only sixteen, as we learn from the prologue to act iv. of _The\\nWinter\\'s Tale_.\\n\\nIn Juliet\\'s case, I believe that the youthfulness was an essential\\nelement in Shakespeare\\'s conception of the character. With the parents\\nand the Nurse he has given her, she could only have been, at the opening\\nof the play, the mere girl he makes her. She must be too young to have\\ndiscovered the real character of her father and mother, and to have been\\nchilled and hardened by learning how unlike they were to the ideals of\\nher childhood. She must not have come to comprehend fully the low coarse\\nnature of the Nurse, her foster-mother. The poet would not have dared to\\nleave the maiden under the influence of that gross creature till she was\\neighteen, or even sixteen. As it is, she has not been harmed by the\\nprurient vulgarity of the garrulous dame. She never shows any interest\\nin it, or seems even to notice it. When her mother first refers to the\\nsuit of Paris (i. 3) we see that no thought of love or marriage has ever\\noccurred to her, and the glowing description of a noble and wealthy\\nyoung wooer does not excite her imagination in the least. Her only\\nresponse to all that the Lady and the Nurse have urged in praise of\\nParis is coldly acquiescent:--\\n\\n  \"I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move;\\n  But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\n  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\"\\n\\nThe playful manner in which Juliet receives the advances of Romeo (i. 5.\\n95-109) is thoroughly girlish, though we must note that his first\\nspeech, as given in the play (\"If I profane,\" etc.), is not the\\nbeginning of their conversation, which has been going on while Capulet\\nand Tybalt were talking. This is the first and the last glimpse that we\\nget of her bright young sportiveness. With the kiss that ends the pretty\\nquibbling the girl learns what love means, and the larger life of\\nwomanhood begins.\\n\\nThe \"balcony scene\" (ii. 2)--the most exquisite love scene ever\\nwritten--is in perfect keeping with the poet\\'s conception of Juliet as\\nlittle more than a child--still childlike in the expression of the new\\nlove that is making her a woman. Hence the absolute frankness in her\\navowal of that love--an ideal love in which passion and purity are\\nperfectly interfused. There is not a suggestion of sensuality on Romeo\\'s\\npart any more than on hers. When he asks, \"O, wilt thou leave me so\\nunsatisfied?\" it is only the half-involuntary utterance of the man\\'s\\nimpatience--so natural to the man--that the full fruition of his love\\nmust be delayed. Juliet knows that it involves no base suggestion, and a\\ntouch of tender sympathy and pity is mingled with the maiden wisdom of\\nthe innocent response, \"What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\"\\n\\nLady Martin (Helena Faucit), who has played the part of Juliet with rare\\npower and grace, and has written about it no less admirably, remarks on\\nthis scene: \"Women are deeply in debt to Shakespeare for all the lovely\\nand noble things he has put into his women\\'s hearts and mouths, but\\nsurely for nothing more than for the words in which Juliet\\'s reply [to\\nRomeo, when he has overheard her soliloquy in the balcony] is couched.\\nOnly one who knew of what a true woman is capable, in frankness, in\\ncourage, and self-surrender when her heart is possessed by a noble love,\\ncould have touched with such delicacy, such infinite charm of mingled\\nreserve and artless frankness, the avowal of so fervent, yet so modest a\\nlove, the secret of which had been so strangely stolen from her. As the\\nwhole scene is the noblest pÃ¦an to Love ever written, so is what Juliet\\nsays supreme in subtlety of feeling and expression, where all is\\nbeautiful. Watch all the fluctuations of emotion which pervade it, ...\\nthe generous frankness of the giving, the timid drawing back, fearful of\\nhaving given too much unsought; the perplexity of the whole, all summed\\nup in that sweet entreaty for pardon with which it closes.\"\\n\\nJuliet\\'s soliloquy in iii. 3 is no less remarkable for its chaste and\\nreverent dealing with a situation even more perilous for the dramatist.\\nWe must not forget that it _is_ a soliloquy, \"breathed out in the\\nsilence and solitude of her chamber,\" as Mrs. Jameson reminds us; or, we\\nmay say, not so much as breathed out, but only thought and felt,\\nunuttered even when no one could have heard it. As spoken to a\\ntheatrical audience, it is only to a sympathetic listener who\\nappreciates the situation that it can have its true effect, and one\\nfeels almost guilty and ashamed at having intruded upon the sacred\\nprivacy of the maiden meditation. Even to comment upon it seems like\\nprofanity.\\n\\nHere, as in the balcony scene, Juliet is simply the \"impatient child\" to\\nwhom she compares herself, looking forward with mingled innocence and\\neagerness to the fruition of the \"tender wishes blossoming at night\"\\nthat inspire the soliloquy.\\n\\nIn one of Romeo\\'s speeches in the interview with Friar Laurence after\\nthe death of Tybalt (iii. 3), there is a delicate tribute to the girlish\\npurity and timidity of Juliet, though it occurs in a connection so\\nrepellent to our taste that we may fail to note it. This is the\\npassage:--\\n\\n                                \"heaven is here,\\n  Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog\\n  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\n  Live here in heaven and may look on her,\\n  But Romeo may not. More validity,\\n  More honourable state, more courtship lives\\n  In carrion-flies than Romeo. They may seize\\n  On the white wonder of dear Juliet\\'s hand\\n  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\n  Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,\\n  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin:\\n  But Romeo may not, he is banished.\\n  This may flies do, when I from this must fly;\\n  They are free men, but I am banished.\"\\n\\nThis is unquestionably from the earliest draft of the play, and is a\\nspecimen of the most intolerable class of Elizabethan conceits. As\\nanother has said, \"Perhaps the worst line that Shakespeare or any other\\npoet ever wrote, is the dreadful one where Romeo, in the very height of\\nhis passionate despair, says, \\'This may _flies_ do, but I from this must\\n_fly_.\\'\" It comes in \"with an obtrusive incongruity which absolutely\\nmakes one shudder.\" The allusion to the \"carrion flies\" is bad enough,\\nbut the added pun on _fly_, which makes the allusion appear deliberate\\nand elaborate rather than an unfortunate lapse due to the excitement of\\nthe moment, forbids any attempt to excuse or palliate it. But we must\\nnot overlook the exquisite reference to Juliet\\'s lips, that--\\n\\n      \"even in pure and vestal modesty\\n  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\"\\n\\nThere we have the true Juliet--the Juliet whose maiden modesty and\\ninnocence certain critics (in their comments upon the soliloquy in iii.\\n3) have been too gross to comprehend. It is to Romeo\\'s honour that he\\ncan understand and feel it even when recalling the passionate exchange\\nof conjugal kisses.\\n\\nThe scene (iv. 3) in which Juliet drinks the potion has been\\nmisinterpreted by some of the best critics. Coleridge says that she\\n\"swallows the draught in a fit of fright,\" for it would have been \"too\\nbold a thing\" for a girl of fourteen to have done it otherwise. Mrs.\\nJameson says that, \"gradually and most naturally, in such a mind once\\n_thrown off its poise_, the horror rises to _frenzy_,--her imagination\\nrealizes its own hideous creations,\"--that is, after picturing all the\\npossible horrors of the tomb, she _sees_, or believes she sees, the\\nghost of Tybalt, and drinks the potion in the frenzied apprehension the\\nvision excites. On the contrary, as George Fletcher remarks, \"the very\\nclearness and completeness with which her mind embraces her present\\nposition make her pass in lucid review, and in the most natural and\\nlogical sequence, the several dismal contingencies that await her\"--thus\\nleading up, \"step by step, to this climax of the accumulated horrors,\\nnot which she _may_, but which she _must_ encounter, if she wake before\\nthe calculated moment. This pressure on her brain, crowned by the vivid\\napprehension of _anticipated_ frenzy, does, indeed, amid her dim and\\nsilent loneliness, produce a momentary hallucination [of Tybalt\\'s\\nghost], but she instantly recovers herself, recognizes the illusion, ...\\nembraces the one chance of earthly reunion with her lord--\\'Romeo, I\\ncome! this do I drink to thee!\\'\"\\n\\nThis is substantially Lady Martin\\'s interpretation of the scene, and\\nthat which she carried out in action on the stage. She says: \"For the\\nmoment the great fear gets the better of her great love, and all seems\\nmadness. Then in her frenzy of excitement she seems to see Tybalt\\'s\\nfigure \\'seeking out Romeo.\\' At the mention of Romeo\\'s name I used to\\nfeel all my resolution return. Romeo! She goes to meet him, and what\\nterror shall hold her back? She will pass through the horror of hell\\nitself to reach what lies beyond; and she swallows the potion with his\\nname upon her lips.\" The lady adds: \"What it is to act it I need not\\ntell. What power it demands! and yet what restraint!\"\\n\\nROMEO.--Some critics have expressed surprise that Shakespeare should\\nhave preluded the main story of the drama with the \"superfluous\\ncomplication\" of Romeo\\'s love for Rosaline. On the other hand, Coleridge\\nconsiders it \"a strong instance of the fineness of his insight into the\\nnature of the passions.\" He adds: \"The necessity of loving creates an\\nobject for itself in man and woman; and yet there is a difference in\\nthis respect between the sexes, though only to be known by a perception\\nof it. It would have displeased us if Juliet had been represented as\\nalready in love, or as fancying herself so; but no one, I believe, ever\\nexperiences any shock at Romeo\\'s forgetting his Rosaline, who had been a\\nmere name for the yearning of his youthful imagination, and rushing into\\nhis passion for Juliet.\" Mrs. Jameson says: \"Our impression of Juliet\\'s\\nloveliness and sensibility is enhanced when we find it overcoming in the\\nbosom of Romeo a previous love for another. His visionary passion for\\nthe cold, inaccessible Rosaline forms but the prologue, the threshold,\\nto the true, the real sentiment which succeeds to it. This incident,\\nwhich is found in the original story, has been retained by Shakspeare\\nwith equal feeling and judgment; and, far from being a fault in taste\\nand sentiment, far from prejudicing us against Romeo by casting on him,\\nat the outset of the piece, the stigma of inconstancy, it becomes, if\\nproperly considered, a beauty in the drama, and adds a fresh stroke of\\ntruth to the portrait of the lover. Why, after all, should we be\\noffended at what does not offend Juliet herself? for in the original\\nstory we find that her attention is first attracted towards Romeo by\\nseeing him \\'fancy-sick and pale of cheer,\\' for love of a cold beauty.\"\\n\\nThe German critic Kreyssig aptly remarks: \"We make the acquaintance of\\nRomeo at the critical period of that not dangerous sickness to which\\nyouth is liable. It is that \\'love lying in the eyes\\' of early and just\\nblossoming manhood, that humorsome, whimsical \\'love in idleness,\\' that\\nfirst bewildered, stammering interview of the heart with the scarcely\\nawakened nature. Strangely enough, objections have been made to this\\n\\'superfluous complication,\\' as if, down to this day, every Romeo had not\\nto sigh for some Junonian Rosaline, nay, for half a dozen Rosalines,\\nmore or less, before his eyes open upon his Juliet.\"\\n\\nYoung men of ardent and sentimental nature, as Kreyssig intimates,\\nimagine themselves in love--sometimes again and again--before a genuine\\npassion takes possession of them. As Rosalind expresses it, Cupid may\\nhave \"clapped them on the shoulder,\" but, they are really \"heart-whole.\"\\nSuch love is like that of the song in _The Merchant of Venice_:--\\n\\n  \"It is engender\\'d in the eyes,\\n  By gazing fed, and fancy dies\\n  In the cradle where it lies.\"\\n\\nIt lives only until it is displaced by a healthier, more vigorous love,\\ncapable of outgrowing the precarious period of infancy.[8] This is not\\nthe only instance of the kind in Shakespeare. Orsino\\'s experience in\\n_Twelfth Night_ is similar to Romeo\\'s. At the beginning of the play he\\nis suffering from unrequited love for Olivia, but later finds his Juliet\\nin Viola.\\n\\nRomeo is a very young man--if indeed we may call him a man when we first\\nmeet him. We may suppose him to be twenty, but hardly older. He has seen\\nvery little of society, as we infer from Benvolio\\'s advising him to go\\nto the masquerade at Capulet\\'s, in order to compare \"the admired\\nbeauties of Verona\" with Rosaline. He had thought her \"fair, none else\\nbeing by.\" He is hardly less \"a stranger in the world\" than Juliet\\nhimself. Love develops him as it does her, but more slowly.\\n\\nContrast the strength of Juliet\\'s new-born heroism in her budding\\nwomanhood, when she drinks the potion that is to consign her to the\\nhorrors of the charnel-house, with the weakness of Romeo who is ready to\\nkill himself when he learns that he is to be banished from Verona,--an\\ninsignificant fate compared with that which threatens her--banishment\\nfrom home, a beggar in the streets,--the only alternative a criminal\\nmarriage that would forever separate her from her lawful husband, or\\ndeath to escape that guilt and wretchedness. No wonder that the Friar\\ncannot control his contempt and indignation when Romeo draws his\\nsword:--\\n\\n                    \"Hold thy desperate hand!\\n  Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art;\\n  Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\\n  The unreasonable fury of a beast,\\n  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\\n  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\\n  Thou hast amaz\\'d me; by my holy order,\\n  I thought thy disposition better temper\\'d.\\n  Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?\\n  And slay thy lady too that lives in thee,\\n  By doing damned hate upon thyself?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,\\n  For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;\\n  There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\\n  But thou slew\\'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too.\\n  The law that threaten\\'d death becomes thy friend\\n  And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.\\n  A pack of blessings lights upon thy back,\\n  Happiness courts thee in her best array;\\n  But, like a misbehav\\'d and sullen wench,\\n  Thou pout\\'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\\n  Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\"\\n\\nHe has the form of a man, but talks and acts like a weak girl, while the\\ngirl of fourteen whom he loves--a child three days before, we might\\nsay--now shows a self-control and fortitude worthy of a man.\\n\\nRomeo does not attain to true manhood until he receives the tidings of\\nJuliet\\'s supposed death. \"Now, for the first time,\" as Dowden says, \"he\\nis completely delivered from the life of dream, completely adult, and\\nable to act with an initiative in his own will, and with manly\\ndetermination. Accordingly, he now speaks with masculine directness and\\nenergy: \\'Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\\' Yes; he is now master\\nof events; the stars cannot alter his course. \\'Nothing,\\' as Maginn has\\nobserved, \\'can be more quiet than his final determination, \"Well,\\nJuliet, I will lie with thee to night.\" ... It is plain Juliet. His mind\\nis made up; the whole course of the short remainder of his life so\\nunalterably fixed that it is perfectly useless to think more about it.\\'\\nThese words, because they are the simplest, are amongst the most\\nmemorable that Romeo utters. Now passion, imagination, and will are\\nfused together, and Romeo who was weak has at length become strong.\"\\n\\n[Footnote 8: Praed alludes to this affection of the \"salad days\" of\\nyouth in _The Belle of the Ball-room_:--\\n\\n  \"Through sunny May, through sultry June,\\n    I loved her with a love eternal.\"\\n\\nThat is about the average span of its \"eternity.\" In Romeo\\'s case it did\\nnot last even two months, as we may infer from the fact (i. 1. 136) that\\nhis parents have not found out the cause of it, and from what his\\nfriends say about it.]\\n\\nMERCUTIO.--Dryden quotes a traditional saying concerning Mercutio, that\\nif Shakespeare had not killed him, he would have killed Shakespeare. But\\nShakespeare was never driven to disposing of a personage in that way,\\nbecause he was unequal to the effort of maintaining the full vigour or\\nbrilliancy of the characterization. He did not have to kill off\\nFalstaff, for instance, until he had carried him through three complete\\nplays, and then only because his \"occupation,\" dramatically speaking,\\n\"was gone.\" There was the same reason for killing Mercutio. The\\ndramatist had no further use for him after the quarrel with Tybalt which\\nleads to his death. In both the novel and the poem, Romeo kills Tybalt\\nin a street brawl between the partisans of the rival houses. The\\ndramatic effect of the scene in the play where Romeo avoids being drawn\\ninto a conflict with Tybalt until driven to incontrollable grief and\\nwrath by the death of his friend is far more impressive. The\\nself-control and self-restraint of Romeo, in spite of the insults of\\nTybalt and the disgust of Mercutio at what seems to him \"calm,\\ndishonourable, vile submission,\" show how reluctant the lover of Juliet\\nis to fight with her kinsman. He does his best to restrain his friend\\nfrom the duel: \"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up--\" but to no purpose;\\nnor is his appeal to Benvolio to \"beat down their weapons\" more\\nsuccessful. He then attempts to do this himself, but the only result is\\nto bring about the death of Mercutio, who exclaims: \"Why the devil came\\nyou between us? I was hurt under your arm.\" Poor Romeo can only plead,\\n\"I thought all for the best.\"\\n\\nBut at this point in the play, when the tragic complication really\\nbegins, the dramatist must dismiss Mercutio from the stage, as he does\\nwith Falstaff after Prince Hal has become King. Mercutio must not come\\nin contact with Juliet, nor will Romeo himself care to meet him. He is\\nthe most foul-mouthed of Shakespeare\\'s characters, the clowns and\\nprofligates not excepted. The only instance in Shakespeare\\'s works in\\nwhich the original editions omit a word from the text is in a speech of\\nMercutio\\'s; and Pope, who could on occasion be as coarse as any author\\nof that licentious age, felt obliged to drop two of Mercutio\\'s lines\\nfrom his edition of the dramatist. Fortunately, the majority of the\\nknight\\'s gross allusions are so obscure that they would not be\\nunderstood nowadays, even by readers quite familiar with the language of\\nthe time.\\n\\nAnd yet Mercutio is a fellow of excellent fancy--poetical fancy--as the\\nfamiliar description of Queen Mab amply proves. Critics have picked it\\nto pieces and found fault with some of the details; but there was never\\na finer mingling of exquisite poetry with keen and sparkling wit. Its\\nimperfections and inconsistencies, if such they be, are in keeping with\\nthe character and the situation. It was meant to be a brilliant\\nimprovisation, not a carefully elaborated composition. Shakespeare may,\\nindeed, have written the speech as rapidly and carelessly as he makes\\nMercutio speak it.\\n\\n\\nLIST OF CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY\\n\\nThe numbers in parentheses indicate the lines the characters have in\\neach scene.\\n\\n_Escalus_: i. 1(23); iii. 1(16); v. 3(36).
